## Prompt:
Create:
A concept deck

## Response:
Below is a **clean, presentation-ready concept deck** for the _interactive, blockchain-enhanced CV/résumé system_ we have been defining. It is structured as a slide deck with section headers, key points, and optional visuals.

I include **image groups** only where they add conceptual clarity.

**Title:**  
**in–midst–my-life: A Next-Generation Interactive CV**

**Core Idea:**  
A dynamic, verifiable, user-driven representation of one’s professional and creative trajectory, powered by decentralized identity, modular storytelling, and attested credentials.

* * *

2\. Problem Statement
---------------------

**Static CVs are obsolete.**  
Traditional résumés:

*   Cannot verify claims.
*   Do not convey multidimensional creative/technical practice.
*   Are not interactive or adaptive to context.
*   Fail to show work in motion or across mediums.
*   Are stuck in linear, PDF-era constraints.

**Organizations lack a trusted way to evaluate an individual’s real contributions, capabilities, and timelines.**

* * *

3\. Vision

**A living CV that evolves with you.**  
A system where:

*   Identity is controlled by the user.
*   Achievements and work are verifiable.
*   Sections adapt to the viewer (employer, curator, collaborator).
*   The user can “change masks” to represent different roles or modes.
*   The narrative timeline is explorable, not fixed.

* * *

4\. Core Components
-------------------

### A. Decentralized Identity Layer

*   DID / ENS-style identifier
*   Verifiable ownership of identity
*   Privacy-selective disclosure
*   A “name card” you actually own

### B. Verifiable Credentials Registry

*   Employers, schools, collaborators issue signed attestations
*   Credentials become universal, cross-platform, permanent
*   Replaces unverified bullet points with cryptographically signed history

### C. Soulbound / Reputation Layer

*   Reputation tokens or attestations that cannot be transferred
*   Captures trust, endorsements, and proven contributions

### D. Interactive CV Presentation Layer

*   Mask-based personas (artist, scholar, programmer, etc.)
*   Timeline + knowledge graph + media-driven narrative
*   Content recomposes per viewer or per “mask” toggle
*   Dynamic filtering: skills, outputs, projects, collaborations, era

* * *

5\. The “Mask” System (Persona Engine)
--------------------------------------

![https://themaskhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-history-and-meaning-of-theater-masks.jpg](https://themaskhistory.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/the-history-and-meaning-of-theater-masks.jpg)

![https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipbHHznQo74WYgnLwNzp5J.jpg](https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/ipbHHznQo74WYgnLwNzp5J.jpg)

![https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_632_webp/7bdd01174542745.64a4519cca31c.png](https://mir-s3-cdn-cf.behance.net/project_modules/max_632_webp/7bdd01174542745.64a4519cca31c.png)

A role-based view system:

*   Each mask is a self-contained professional/creative identity mode.
*   Toggling masks reorganizes the résumé:
    *   Projects emphasized
    *   Skills surfaced
    *   Credentials filtered
    *   Tone and framing shift automatically
*   Masks correspond to _user-defined professional archetypes_  
    Example masks:
    *   Multimedia Artist
    *   Scholar / Researcher
    *   Software Engineer
    *   Creative Technologist

* * *

6\. Experience Architecture
---------------------------

**User Flow**

1.  User verifies identity (DID).
2.  System imports or receives VCs (education, roles, publications).
3.  User uploads work artifacts and tags them semantically.
4.  Persona-engine generates multiple narrative skins.
5.  Viewer accesses through a public or selectively shared link.
6.  Viewer sees tamper-proof verifications for each claim.

**Viewer Experience**

*   Dynamic timeline
*   Zoomable knowledge graph
*   Media galleries
*   Verified credentials overlay
*   Projects grouped by mask/persona

* * *

7\. System Architecture Snapshot
--------------------------------

(Abridged conceptual version; full technical diagram exists separately.)

**Layers**

1.  Identity: DID + Wallet
2.  Credential Registry: VC issuance + storage index
3.  Metadata Graph: Projects, skills, outputs
4.  Persona Engine: Mask-based filtering and framing
5.  UI Layer: Interactive CV / résumé views
6.  Optional AI Layer: Custom narrative generation, summaries, interactive Q/A

* * *

8\. Differentiators
-------------------

**Modular**  
Users can rearrange and reframe their CV dynamically.

**Verifiable**  
Credentials can be cryptographically confirmed.

**Expressive**  
Media, narrative arcs, and role-based masks allow full-dimensional identity.

**Interoperable**  
Built on decentralized standards rather than locked platforms.

**Adaptive**  
Employers, curators, committees, or collaborators can see tailored views.

* * *

9\. Example Use Cases
---------------------

### For Creatives

*   Showcase work across mediums with narrative depth.

### For Researchers

*   Verified publications, affiliations, grants, roles.

### For Technologists

*   Demonstrate contributions, code provenance, verified skills.

### For Hybrid Professionals

*   Seamlessly switch between identities without fragmentation.

* * *

10\. Long-Term Trajectory
-------------------------

**From CV → Personal Operating System for Work History**

Future capabilities:

*   Cross-application identity sync
*   Verified collaboration networks
*   AI-driven “explain this part of my work” agents
*   Portable professional reputation
*   Mixed-reality presentation of one’s timeline
*   Automated attestations from saved workflows or commits

* * *

11\. Closing Concept

**Your professional life becomes a navigable, verifiable, adaptive environment—  
not a document.**

If you want, I can also provide:

*   A polished PDF layout of this deck
*   A Figma storyboard for the interactive CV
*   A visual system / branding concept
*   A pitch deck version (investor-facing)
*   A technical deep dive version for engineers

What would you like to produce next?
