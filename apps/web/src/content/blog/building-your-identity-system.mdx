## Beyond the Résumé

A traditional résumé forces you into a single narrative. But your career isn't a single story — it's a collection of perspectives, each valid, each revealing different facets of who you are professionally.

**in midst my life** gives you the tools to build a *system* around your identity, not just a document.

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Identity Masks

Masks are contextual lenses for your professional identity. Each mask:

- **Filters** which experiences are most relevant
- **Reframes** accomplishments in a specific voice
- **Emphasizes** skills that matter for a particular audience

You might use the **Synthesist** mask when applying to cross-functional roles, the **Artisan** mask for craft-focused positions, or the **Strategist** mask for leadership conversations.

The system ships with 15+ pre-built masks, and you can customize or create your own.

### 2. Temporal Epochs

Instead of a flat chronological list, epochs organize your career into meaningful chapters:

- **Foundational** — Early career, skill acquisition, first professional identity
- **Growth** — Expanding scope, deepening expertise, building reputation
- **Leadership** — Influencing direction, mentoring, strategic thinking
- **Reinvention** — Career pivots, new domains, deliberate transformation

Each epoch carries metadata about its themes, key skills developed, and defining moments.

### 3. Career Stages

Stages represent your progression within a domain:

- **Apprentice** — Learning the craft, absorbing patterns
- **Journeyman** — Independent contribution, reliable execution
- **Master** — Setting direction, teaching others, pushing boundaries

Stages can overlap with epochs — you might be a Master in backend engineering while simultaneously an Apprentice in machine learning.

## Putting It Together

When you generate a narrative (via the API or the dashboard), the system:

1. Selects the appropriate **mask** for the context
2. Filters experiences through the mask's lens
3. Organizes them by **epoch** for narrative structure
4. Annotates with **stage** progression to show growth
5. Generates prose in the mask's voice

The result is a living document that adapts to every audience while staying true to your actual experience.

## Getting Started

1. **Set up your profile** — Import your basic career data via the dashboard
2. **Explore masks** — Try different masks on the same profile to see how your story shifts
3. **Define your epochs** — Break your career into meaningful chapters
4. **Generate narratives** — Use the narrative engine to produce context-specific presentations
