## What is the Hunter Protocol?

The Hunter Protocol is our agent-driven job search system. Instead of manually browsing job boards and tailoring your resume for each application, the Hunter Protocol automates the entire workflow:

1. **Search** — Find relevant jobs using semantic keyword matching
2. **Analyze** — Score compatibility between your profile and each opportunity
3. **Tailor** — Generate a mask-specific resume optimized for the role
4. **Apply** — Produce cover letters that speak in the voice of your selected persona

## Setting Up Your First Search

Navigate to the Hunter dashboard from any profile page. You'll see a search interface that accepts:

- **Keywords** — Skills, technologies, or role titles (e.g., "TypeScript", "Staff Engineer")
- **Remote preference** — Filter by remote, hybrid, or on-site
- **Max results** — Control how many opportunities to evaluate

```
POST /profiles/:id/hunter/search
{
  "keywords": ["TypeScript", "distributed systems"],
  "remote_requirement": "hybrid",
  "max_results": 10
}
```

The search engine returns scored results with metadata about each opportunity.

## Understanding Compatibility Scores

When you analyze a job, the system evaluates three dimensions:

- **Technical fit** — How well your skills match the requirements
- **Experience alignment** — Whether your career stage matches expectations
- **Cultural signals** — Subtle indicators from the job description

Each dimension contributes to an overall compatibility score and a recommendation: *strong match*, *moderate fit*, or *stretch role*.

## Choosing the Right Mask

Your identity masks aren't just presentation layers — they're strategic tools. For a systems architecture role, the **Architect** mask emphasizes design decisions and technical leadership. For a data-heavy position, the **Analyst** mask foregrounds quantitative work and analytical methodology.

The `personaId` parameter in the API calls maps directly to your configured masks. Experiment with different masks for the same job to see how the narrative shifts.

## Resume Tailoring

The tailoring engine doesn't just shuffle bullet points. It:

- **Emphasizes** experiences that align with the job requirements
- **De-emphasizes** work that's less relevant (without removing it)
- **Reframes** accomplishments in the language of the target role

The result is a resume that reads like it was written specifically for that position — because it was.

## What's Next

The Hunter Protocol is evolving. Upcoming features include batch application workflows, interview preparation agents, and follow-up tracking. Watch the [blog](/blog) for updates.
