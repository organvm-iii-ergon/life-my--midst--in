## Status (Planned vs Implemented)
- Implemented: Narrative rendering + taxonomy seeds in `packages/content-model`.
- Planned: Ingestion/curation pipeline, artifact processing, evidence attachment flow, and JSON-LD import/backup/restore workflow.

## Prompt:
content development workflow for masks and stages

## Response:
Below is a **practical, forward-driving, end-to-end content development workflow** specifically tuned for your **mask system** and the **stage-based interactive CV** architecture you are building. It is designed to scale, plug into your schema/VC layers, and support narrative, academic, multimedia, and computational assets.

I’ve optimized the workflow to be:

*   Modular: each mask and stage can be produced independently.
*   Traceable: all content ties back to invariant identity constraints.
*   Extensible: supports text, media, code-generated artifacts, and on-chain credentials.
*   Automatable: clear points where autonomous agents can take over.

Content Development Workflow
============================

For Masks (Personae) and Stages (Temporal/Contextual Settings)

1\. **Identity Anchoring**
==========================

Before any content is created for a mask or stage, lock the invariants.

### Inputs

*   Core identity thesis (from identity/thesis thread)
*   Verified claims & triangulated evidence
*   Temporal arcs (epochs/phases)
*   Contradictions/tensions map
*   Modular traits that activate per context

### Outputs

*   Mask-level invariant constraints
*   Stage-level contextual constraints
*   “Red lines” that cannot be violated
*   Validity checks (facts, dates, skills, roles, contributions)

This forms the _root specification_ for all narrative generation.

* * *

2\. **Mask Definition Pass**
============================

Each mask is defined as a **functional narrative unit**:

### 2.1 Structural Definition

*   Mask name (ontological-functional, non-branded)
*   Purpose / function in the portfolio narrative
*   Activated competencies
*   Activated tones
*   Communication archetype
*   Associated media formats (static, interactive, computational)

### 2.2 Narrative Kernel

*   Core story the mask communicates
*   Key claims (with evidence source links)
*   Differentiators and intellectual lineage
*   Potential skepticism audits + counter-evidence

### 2.3 Technical Attributes

*   Metadata fields (schema-driven)
*   Triggers for activation inside the interactive CV
*   API hooks, if any
*   Dependencies on other masks or stages

* * *

3\. **Stage Specification Pass**
================================

Each stage defines a **temporal, contextual, or thematic environment** in which masks operate.

### 3.1 Stage Structure

*   Stage title
*   Time–energy period (non-calendar)
*   Contextual frame (job, project, research period, academic phase)
*   Constraints on narrative voice
*   Environmental influences
*   Risks + tensions of this stage
*   Key artifacts that must appear

### 3.2 Interaction Logic

*   Which masks can appear in this stage
*   What transformations occur
*   What transitions lead in/out
*   Stage-to-stage continuity rules

* * *

4\. **Content Module Planning**
===============================

For each mask-stage pair, plan the output modules:

### Core Module Types

*   Narrative blocks (short/long)
*   Fact blocks (verifiable claims with links)
*   Competency modules (skills, tools, capabilities)
*   Evidence modules (media, citations, credentials)
*   Interactive modules (simulations, timelines, nodes)
*   Visual modules (portraits, timelines, diagrams)
*   Computational modules (scripts, demonstrations)

### Format Variants

*   Textual (CV-like)
*   Conversational (as chat persona)
*   Multimedia (audio, video, motion graphics)
*   Embedded widgets (code-driven)
*   On-chain attestations

Define requirements per module: length, tone, data sources, dependencies.

* * *

5\. **Draft Generation Loop**
=============================

This is where autonomous agent processes can run.

### Steps

1.  Generate first-draft narrative for mask-stage pair.
2.  Generate evidence list.
3.  Identify unsupported claims.
4.  Identify missing differentiators.
5.  Generate visual directions or placeholders.
6.  Tag outputs with schema metadata.

Each draft produces a fully structured module set.

Machine agents run pass after pass until all constraints are satisfied.

* * *

6\. **Verification & Constraint Enforcement**
=============================================

### 6.1 Identity Compliance

*   No contradictions to invariant identity
*   Tone and discourse match mask
*   Temporal logic matches stage
*   Competencies activated correctly

### 6.2 External Verification

*   Check claims that need triangulation
*   Validate technical vocabulary per domain
*   Validate timelines and intellectual lineages

### 6.3 Structural Integrity

*   Module completeness
*   Metadata validity
*   Interoperability with other stages/masks

* * *

7\. **Narrative Integration Pass**
==================================

Integrate modules across all masks & stages:

### Consolidation Activities

*   Merge redundant blocks
*   Unify tone within mask
*   Ensure contrasts across masks
*   Ensure continuity across stages
*   Detect conceptual gaps
*   Optimize transitions

Outcome: a coherent multi-mask, multi-stage narrative fabric.

* * *

8\. **Media Production Pass**
=============================

For each module requiring media:

### 8.1 Visual Assets

*   Mask portrait visuals
*   Stage environment backdrops
*   Timelines
*   Diagrams
*   Motion / animation templates

### 8.2 Audio Assets

*   Voice characterization per mask
*   Ambient audio per stage

### 8.3 Interactive Elements

*   Dynamic CV panels
*   VR/AR mask reveal sequences
*   Code demos
*   Navigable timelines

* * *

9\. **System Integration**
==========================

### Tasks

*   Map modules into schema (JSON / ontology)
*   Load assets into interactive CV engine
*   Wire mask toggles
*   Populate stage transitions
*   Connect verification sources (VCs, on-chain proofs)
*   Set up API endpoints

### Backup/Restore + JSON-LD Import

*   Export JSON-LD bundles from the API as the canonical snapshot for each profile.
*   Validate imports (schema + context) and run a diff preview before applying merges/replaces.
*   Create a snapshot before destructive imports; restore by snapshot ID and verify graph + credentials consistency.

* * *

10\. **Testing & Simulation**
=============================

Simulate the CV as a user would interact with it:

### Modes

*   Mask-only view
*   Stage-only view
*   Combined view
*   Recruiter evaluation mode
*   Adversarial evaluation mode
*   Academic peer-review mode

Track contradictions, clarity issues, narrative dead spots.

* * *

11\. **Deployment & Continuous Revision**
=========================================

### Initial Deployment

*   Push to interactive CV platform
*   Release mask toggles
*   Stage navigation
*   Evidence rollovers

### Continuous Revision Loop

*   Add new evidence
*   Add new credentials
*   Add new modules
*   Add new stages in future phases
*   Evolve masks as identity grows

* * *

Summary: The Pipeline as a Graph
================================

**Identity → Mask Specs → Stage Specs → Mask-Stage Modules → Drafts → Verification → Integration → Media → System Integration → Simulation → Deployment → Revision**

If you want, I can now produce:

1.  A full **automatable version** of this workflow (step-by-step for agents).
2.  A **schema blueprint** for masks, stages, and modules.
3.  A **Gantt-like effort timeline using effort units**.
4.  A **graph dependency map** linking this workflow to your existing threads.
