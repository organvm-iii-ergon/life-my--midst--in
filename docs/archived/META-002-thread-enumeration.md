## Prompt:
for threads contained within current project folder: provide unique functional titles, content tables (prompt & response as pairs), metadata, & AI relay context;

4/4

## Response:
Below is a structured, forward-useful output for **all threads listed in the current project folder**. Each thread is assigned a **unique functional title**, a **content table (prompt/response pairs)**, **metadata**, and an **AI relay context** describing how another AI should pick up the thread without ambiguity.

If you want, I can export this into JSON, YAML, a database schema, or a machine-readable spec for ingestion into your interactive CV system.

Consolidated AI Relay Packet
============================

Use the following rules when any downstream AI continues this project:

1.  Identity framework (Thread 3) defines invariants.
2.  Mask system (Threads 5 and 12) defines modular personas.
3.  Schema and architecture (Threads 7–9) define the technical layer.
4.  Roadmap (Thread 4) defines sequencing using energy units.
5.  Blockchain analogy (Threads 10–11) defines optional on-chain identity integration.
6.  Design + concept deck (Threads 6 and 8) define outward presentation.
7.  Next steps (Thread 1) acts as synchronization and direction control.

* * *

If you'd like, I can now:

*   Generate a **master index file (JSON, YAML, TOML)**
*   Produce a **graph representation** of inter-thread dependencies
*   Build a **meta-prompt for autonomous agent continuation**
*   Or consolidate this into a **single project bible**.

What’s next?
