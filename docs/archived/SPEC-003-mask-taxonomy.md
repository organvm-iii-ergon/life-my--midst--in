## Status (Planned vs Implemented)
- Implemented: Mask list, stage taxonomy, epoch periods, explicit personality taxonomy, settings taxonomy, relations (mask-personality, stage-setting, period-modulates-mask), and admin UI for taxonomy editing.
- Planned: Deeper taxonomy tooling (bulk import/export, validation workflows).

## Prompt:
Draft: ontological-functional-non-branded names for masks and their personalities, stages and their settings, periods in time;

3/3

## Response:
Below is a **draft ontology** of **functional, non-branded names** for masks, personalities, stages, settings, and temporal periods. It is structured so you can plug it directly into your interactive CV/resumé system as a conceptual layer or metadata taxonomy. It avoids stylistic trademarks and positions each term as a clean, abstract, reusable label.

* * *

1\. Masks (Identity-Modes)
==========================

**Definition:** A _mask_ is an operational identity-state the subject adopts for a task, project, or context.  
**Naming principle:** Functional, archetypal, non-mythic, non-commercial.

1.1 Cognitive Masks
-------------------

*   **The Analyst Mask**  
    Function: Precision reasoning, decomposition, structure.
*   **The Synthesist Mask**  
    Function: Pattern-merging, integrative creativity.
*   **The Observer Mask**  
    Function: Detached perception, data intake, weak intervention.
*   **The Strategist Mask**  
    Function: Long-horizon planning, resource orchestration.
*   **The Speculator Mask**  
    Function: Hypothesis generation, scenario projection.
*   **The Interpreter Mask**  
    Function: Translating across media, domains, or audiences.

1.2 Expressive Masks
--------------------

*   **The Artisan Mask**  
    Function: Craft-level creation, meticulous refinement.
*   **The Architect Mask**  
    Function: Systems composition, conceptual framing.
*   **The Narrator Mask**  
    Function: Framing meaning, storyline coherence.
*   **The Provoker Mask**  
    Function: Disruption, tension-generation, boundary-pushing.
*   **The Mediator Mask**  
    Function: Negotiation, harmonization, bridging.

1.3 Operational Masks
---------------------

*   **The Executor Mask**  
    Function: Action, throughput, closure.
*   **The Steward Mask**  
    Function: Maintenance, governance, oversight.
*   **The Integrator Mask**  
    Function: Cross-team assembly, interoperability.
*   **The Custodian Mask**  
    Function: Record-keeping, curation, historical fidelity.
*   **The Calibrator Mask**  
    Function: Evaluation, metrics, standards alignment.

* * *

2\. Personalities (Characteristic Dispositions)
===============================================

**Definition:** The internal behavioral logic the mask operates with.  
**Naming principle:** Abstract, functional temperaments rather than psychological brands.

*   **Convergent Personality**  
    Orientation: Narrowing, selecting, filtering.
*   **Divergent Personality**  
    Orientation: Expanding, proliferating possibilities.
*   **Reflective Personality**  
    Orientation: Deliberation, meta-cognition.
*   **Assertive Personality**  
    Orientation: Decisive action, high agency.
*   **Adaptive Personality**  
    Orientation: Real-time morphing, situational intelligence.
*   **Investigative Personality**  
    Orientation: Probing, evidence-seeking.
*   **Constructive Personality**  
    Orientation: Building, assembling, iterating.
*   **Disruptive Personality**  
    Orientation: Challenging current structures or norms.
*   **Harmonic Personality**  
    Orientation: Balancing opposing forces or viewpoints.

* * *

3\. Stages (Activity Frames)
============================

**Definition:** Macro-frames in which a mask performs—akin to “scene types” or “task phases.”  
**Naming principle:** Neutral, functional, and applicable to creative, scholarly, and technical domains.

*   **Inquiry Stage**  
    Setting: Research, exploration, question-formation.
*   **Design Stage**  
    Setting: Ideation, architectural thinking, structuring.
*   **Construction Stage**  
    Setting: Production, implementation, artifact creation.
*   **Calibration Stage**  
    Setting: Testing, refinement, verification.
*   **Transmission Stage**  
    Setting: Publishing, dissemination, presentation.
*   **Reflection Stage**  
    Setting: Retrospective analysis, synthesis of learnings.
*   **Negotiation Stage**  
    Setting: Alignment, stakeholder engagement.
*   **Archival Stage**  
    Setting: Documentation, record-setting, versioning.

* * *

4\. Settings (Environmental Contexts)
=====================================

**Definition:** The situational terrain in which the stage occurs.  
**Naming principle:** Abstract, non-geographic, non-branded environments of action.

*   **The Conceptual Setting**  
    Domain: Theory, modeling, abstraction.
*   **The Material Setting**  
    Domain: Tools, media, fabrication.
*   **The Distributed Setting**  
    Domain: Multi-agent systems, networks, collaborations.
*   **The Temporal Setting**  
    Domain: Historical positioning, longevity, timelines.
*   **The Emergent Setting**  
    Domain: Dynamic conditions, novelty, real-time flux.
*   **The Evaluative Setting**  
    Domain: Criteria, benchmarks, scrutiny.
*   **The Narrative Setting**  
    Domain: Communication, context-framing.
*   **The Operational Setting**  
    Domain: Execution, workflow, process.

* * *

5\. Periods (Temporal Ontology)
===============================

**Definition:** Non-chronological, functional time-blocks that describe evolution of identity or work.  
**Naming principle:** Epochal, but abstract.

*   **The Initiation Period**  
    Character: Entry, early formation, foundational skills.
*   **The Expansion Period**  
    Character: Rapid diversification, multi-domain exploration.
*   **The Consolidation Period**  
    Character: Integration, coherence, signature voice emerging.
*   **The Divergence Period**  
    Character: Splintering into sub-modes, branching experimentation.
*   **The Mastery Period**  
    Character: High specialization, peak fluency.
*   **The Reinvention Period**  
    Character: Reboot, reframing, identity transformation.
*   **The Transmission Period**  
    Character: Teaching, sharing, institutionalizing knowledge.
*   **The Legacy Period**  
    Character: Long-term impact, codification, archival standing.

* * *

6\. Optional Structural Layer: Relations
========================================

To transform the ontology into an interactive CV, define core relations:

*   **Mask activates in Stage**  
    e.g., Strategist Mask → Design Stage.
*   **Personality governs Mask**  
    e.g., Divergent Personality → Synthesist Mask.
*   **Stage occurs within Setting**  
    e.g., Calibration Stage → Evaluative Setting.
*   **Periods modulate available Masks**  
    e.g., Reinvention Period → emergence of new masks.
*   **Artifacts inherit metadata from all layers**  
    For any work item: Mask + Personality + Stage + Setting + Period.

* * *

If you want, I can:
===================

*   Generate **taxonomy diagrams**,
*   Create **schema specifications** for implementation,
*   Produce **JSON-LD ontologies**,
*   Or insert this directly into your **interactive CV/resumé engine**.

What refinement should come next?
