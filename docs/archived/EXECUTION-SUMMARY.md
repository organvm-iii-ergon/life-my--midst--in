## The Philosophical Foundation

This is **NOT a simple resume builder**. It's a **theatrical identity operating system** based on profound metaphors:

```
CV ≈ Blockchain Ledger (tamper-resistant chronological record)
Résumé ≈ State Snapshot (selective, context-optimized view)
Masks ≈ Identity Filters (16+ functional personas)
Epochs ≈ Temporal Arcs (life stages with evolution)
Scaenae ≈ Theatrical Stages (contexts where masks perform)
Tabula Personarum ≈ Mask Registry (complete persona catalog)
```

**This is non-negotiable. All commercialization must honor this covenant.**

## Phase Overview (140 EU)

| Phase | Weeks | EU | Focus | Status |
|-------|-------|-----|--------|--------|
| **0: Philosophical** | 1-2 | 12 | Hunter Protocol + Theatrical UI | ⏭️ NEXT |
| **1: Monetization** | 2-4 | 21 | Stripe + Feature Gates + Billing | Ready |
| **2: Deployment** | 3-6 | 18 | Vercel + Neon + Upstash + CI/CD | Ready |
| **3: Portfolio** | 5-8 | 30 | Landing Page + Docs + Demo + Blog | Ready |
| **4: Stabilization** | 7-11 | 28 | UX Polish + PDF + GraphQL + Analytics | Ready |
| **5: Community** | 9-13 | 16 | Content + Beta + GitHub + Discord | Ready |
| **6: Launch** | 12-16 | 15 | Product Hunt + HN + Iteration | Ready |
| **TOTAL** | **16 weeks** | **140 EU** | **Theatrical + Commercial** | **✅ Ready** |

---

## Phase 0: Philosophical Completion (IMMEDIATE - Weeks 1-2)

**Why First?**: Must complete the theatrical vision before commercializing. Rushing to monetization without honoring depth would betray the covenant.

### Stream 0A: Hunter Protocol (6 EU)
**Assistant**: AI #1 (Backend specialist)
**What**:
- `packages/core/src/search/google-jobs.ts` - Serper API integration
- `apps/orchestrator/src/agents/hunter.ts` - Find/analyze/tailor/write tools
- Job ingestion pipeline
- End-to-end testing

**Success**: Find 20 jobs → analyze gaps → tailor resume per mask → generate cover letter

### Stream 0B: Theatrical UI (6 EU)
**Assistant**: AI #2 (Frontend specialist)
**What**:
- `apps/web/src/components/TabulaPersonarum.tsx` - Mask registry CRUD
- `apps/web/src/components/ScaenaeFilter.tsx` - Stage-based visibility
- `apps/web/src/components/AetasTimeline.tsx` - Interactive life-stage timeline
- Mask transitions + theatrical metadata

**Success**: Create mask → Edit attributes → Toggle visibility → See timeline

### Blocker for Phases 1-6
**Nothing** - Phase 0 runs independently. Other phases can start in Week 2.

---

## Critical Execution Rules

### 1. Parallelization is Enabled
- 3-5 AI assistants work simultaneously
- Each stream is independent (see dependency matrix in PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md)
- Daily async standup (one document, no meetings)
- Weekly sync only if blockers appear

### 2. Cross-Stream Dependencies
- **Phase 0 → All others**: Must complete Week 2
- **Stripe (1A) → Billing UI (1D)**: Must complete Week 2 end
- **Feature Gates (1B) → API protection**: Must complete Week 3
- **Infra (2A/B/C) → CI/CD (2D)**: Must complete Week 5

See `/docs/PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` for full dependency matrix.

### 3. Integration Points
- Phase 0 complete: Test Hunter + UI together
- Phase 1 complete: Test Stripe + Feature Gates together
- Phase 2 complete: Test Vercel + Neon + Upstash together
- Phase 3 complete: Integration test with live infrastructure
- Phase 4+: Continuous CI/CD

### 4. Communication Protocol
- **Async Daily Standup**: `/tmp/standup.md` (each AI updates)
- **Weekly Sync**: If blockers need resolution
- **Integration Tests**: After each phase completion
- **Escalation**: Flag blockers > 1 day delay

---

## Success Metrics (End of Month 1)

By end of Week 4, you should have:

**Technical**:
- ✅ Hunter Protocol fully functional (end-to-end testing complete)
- ✅ Theatrical UI polished (components in production-ready state)
- ✅ Stripe integration working (test purchases complete)
- ✅ Feature gates protecting premium endpoints
- ✅ Vercel project created + deployed

**Business**:
- ✅ Pricing tiers defined (Free/Artisan/Dramatist)
- ✅ Neon Postgres provisioned
- ✅ Upstash Redis ready
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD working

**Portfolio**:
- ✅ Landing page HTML drafted
- ✅ Documentation outline created
- ✅ Demo video script written

## Key Difference: Philosophical vs. Commercial

### This Project is NOT:
- ❌ Just another resume builder
- ❌ LinkedIn competitor
- ❌ Generic SaaS with feature stacking

### This Project IS:
- ✅ **Identity OS**: Theatrical identity architecture innovation
- ✅ **Philosophical**: CV ≈ Blockchain, Masks ≈ Perspectives
- ✅ **Covenant-bound**: Identity invariants, theatrical integrity, verification rigor
- ✅ **Authentic Multiplicity**: One person, many masks, all real

**Commercialization must honor this depth.**

## Quick Start: Next 24 Hours

### Preparation (Before assistants begin)
- [ ] Read `/docs/PHASE-ROADMAP.md` (understand philosophy)
- [ ] Read `/docs/PARALLEL-EXECUTION-GUIDE.md` (understand streams)
- [ ] Assign AI assistants to roles above
- [ ] Create shared standup document: `/tmp/standup.md`
- [ ] Create GitHub milestone for Phase 0 completion

### Phase 0 Launch (Weeks 1-2)
- [ ] AI #1 begins: Hunter Protocol implementation (Stream 0A)
- [ ] AI #2 begins: Theatrical UI components (Stream 0B)
- [ ] Daily async updates in standup document
- [ ] Integration testing at Phase 0 completion

### Phase 1 Prep (Week 2, can overlap)
- [ ] Prepare infrastructure credentials (Stripe test API keys, domain, etc.)
- [ ] AI #1 ready to start Stripe (1A) when Phase 0 nears completion
- [ ] AI #2 ready to start Billing UI (1D) when Stripe completes

## Philosophy Statement (Kept Throughout)

From PROJECT BIBLE and COVENANT:

> This system is bound by:
> 1. **Identity Invariants**: Core thesis, values remain consistent across masks
> 2. **Theatrical Integrity**: Masks are perspectives on truth, not lies
> 3. **Temporal Honesty**: Epochs reflect genuine evolution
> 4. **Verification Rigor**: Claims require evidence
> 5. **Modular Multiplicity**: One person, many masks - all authentic
> 6. **Blockchain Metaphor**: CV as ledger, résumé as snapshot

**This is not negotiable. Every decision must honor this covenant.**
