## Prompt:
formal project plan with effort units (each effort unit should be out of a max total, like percent);

## Response:
Below is a **formal, structured project plan** for the _interactive CV/résumé system_ using **effort units expressed as percentages of a fixed total effort budget (100%)**. This gives you an allocative, energy-based roadmap without tying anything to dates.

If you prefer a larger baseline (e.g., 1,000 units or 10,000 units), I can convert it instantly.

**Project Plan: Interactive CV/Résumé System**
==============================================

**Effort Budget: 100 Effort Units (100%)**

* * *

**Phase 1 — Foundations & Architecture**
----------------------------------------

**Total Allocation: 22%**

### 1.1 Requirements Consolidation — 5%

*   Consolidate project bible, dependency graphs, meta-prompts, schema definitions.
*   Define invariant identity, narrative arcs, verification needs.

### 1.2 System Architecture & Data Model — 9%

*   Technical architecture (frontend, backend, content engine, knowledge store).
*   Ontological schema: masks, stages, epochs, narratives, claims, metadata.
*   Versioning and change-tracking logic.

### 1.3 Product Scope & Feature Definition — 8%

*   Define MVP vs. full platform capabilities.
*   Specify user flows (create, browse, export, filter CV modules).
*   Define generative pipelines for narrative assembly.

* * *

**Phase 2 — Core Engine Development**
-------------------------------------

**Total Allocation: 35%**

### 2.1 Narrative Engine — 12%

*   Mask-based identity modulation.
*   Contextual activation rules.
*   Tension and contradiction handling.
*   Multi-layer narrative reconstruction.

### 2.2 Data Structures & Storage Layer — 8%

*   Graph-based relationship model.
*   Claim-verification tagging.
*   Temporal architecture for career epochs.

### 2.3 Interaction Layer (AI Prompt Engine) — 9%

*   Autonomous agent meta-prompt.
*   Modular prompt templates per domain.
*   Deep-research and prospecting logic.

### 2.4 Rendering Engine — 6%

*   Export formats (interactive, static resume, academic CV, mask-filtered view).
*   Frontend service to assemble visuals dynamically.

* * *

**Phase 3 — Feature Implementation**
------------------------------------

**Total Allocation: 28%**

### 3.1 Interactive Mask System — 10%

*   Mask creation, naming, behavioral profiles.
*   Stage toggles and time-period filters.
*   Rendering rules for different personas.

### 3.2 CV/Resume Generator Modes — 8%

*   Functional CV mode.
*   Narrative portfolio mode.
*   Blockchain-aligned verifiable-credentials mode.

### 3.3 Research & Qualification Engine — 6%

*   Domain-specific deep-research prompts.
*   Relevance scoring and extraction.
*   Automated gap analysis.

### 3.4 Knowledge Graph Visualization — 4%

*   Inter-thread dependency graph viewer.
*   Timeline & epoch visualizations.

* * *

**Phase 4 — Integration, QA, and Optimization**
-----------------------------------------------

**Total Allocation: 10%**

### 4.1 Model Integration — 4%

*   Link all engines: narrative, research, mask, renderer.
*   End-to-end flow validation.

### 4.2 Quality Assurance — 4%

*   Consistency checks.
*   Relevance and coherence review.
*   Stress-tests on identity constraints.

### 4.3 Optimization — 2%

*   Performance tuning.
*   Prompt simplification.
*   Knowledge-graph compression.

* * *

**Phase 5 — Packaging & Deployment**
------------------------------------

**Total Allocation: 5%**

### 5.1 Deployment & Interfaces — 3%

*   Local/hosted interface deployment.
*   API exposure if required.

### 5.2 Documentation & Design Assets — 2%

*   Concept deck.
*   Design specification.
*   Master index and project bible finalization.

* * *

**Summary Allocation Table**
============================

| Phase | Effort % |
| --- | --- |
| Phase 1: Foundations | 22% |
| Phase 2: Core Engine | 35% |
| Phase 3: Features | 28% |
| Phase 4: QA & Optimization | 10% |
| Phase 5: Deployment | 5% |
| **Total** | **100%** |

* * *

If you want, I can produce:

*   Alternative versions (e.g., 1,000 effort units, energy tokens, or “complexity weights”).
*   A Gantt-like effort sequence.
*   A role-based resource distribution (engineer, designer, researcher).
*   A version optimized for external stakeholders or grant proposals.

Just specify what format you want next.
