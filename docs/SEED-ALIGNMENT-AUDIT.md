# Seed Document Alignment Audit

**Date**: 2026-02-07
**Scope**: Philosophy-to-code alignment across all foundational seed documents
**Methodology**: Systematic comparison of seed documents against implemented codebase, covering originals in `docs/archived/`, consolidated summaries, ADRs, root-level design docs, and the philosophical manifesto
**Companion to**: `docs/FEATURE-AUDIT.md` (spec-to-code audit)

---

## Source Documents

The project's DNA originates from foundational documents compiled across 33 design conversations. These exist in three tiers: (1) original seed documents in `docs/archived/`, (2) consolidated summaries in root-level files, and (3) architectural decision records in `docs/adr/`.

|---------|---------------|----------|--------|
| CV = master ledger (append-only, complete) | `CurriculumVitaeMultiplexSchema` with versioned entries | `packages/schema/src/curriculum-vitae.ts` | ✅ |
| Resume = derived proof (selective, context-optimized) | Mask-filtered CV views via `CVFilterSchema` | `packages/schema/src/curriculum-vitae.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/curriculum-vitae-multiplex.ts` | ✅ |
| Mask = filter that generates resume from CV | 16 masks with activation rules, filters, priority weights | `packages/content-model/src/taxonomy.ts` (`MASK_TAXONOMY`) | ✅ |
| Verification via consensus + signatures | W3C VCs with Ed25519 proofs, 4 DID resolvers | `packages/core/src/vc.ts`, `packages/core/src/did/resolvers/` | ✅ |
| Identity via DID / wallet address | DIDs (did:key, did:jwk, did:pkh, did:web) — software-based | `packages/core/src/did/resolvers/{key,jwk,pkh,web}.ts` | ✅ |
| Selective disclosure (ZKP analogy) | Mask-based filtering + redaction rules | `MaskSchema.redaction` in `packages/schema/src/mask.ts` | ✅ |
| On-chain identity / SBT registry | Not implemented — DIDs are software-only | — | 🔄 Deferred |

### 1.2 Eight Foundational Identity Questions (FOUND-004)

| # | Question | Implementation | Evidence | Status |
|---|----------|---------------|----------|--------|
| 1 | Core identity/thesis invariant across outputs? | `IdentityCoreSchema` defines thesis, invariants, master_keywords | `packages/schema/src/identity.ts` | ⚠️ Schema exists; no dedicated DB persistence |
| 2 | Claims requiring external verification? | VC issuance + verification + attestation blocks | `packages/core/src/vc.ts`, `apps/api/src/routes/attestation-blocks.ts` | ✅ |
| 3 | Temporal arcs defining identity evolution? | 8 epochs: initiation → legacy, with `AetasSchema` lifecycle | `packages/schema/src/epoch.ts`, `packages/content-model/src/taxonomy.ts` | ✅ |
| 4 | Contradictions and their treatment? | Narrative engine handles via `authentic_caveat` and mask tension | `packages/content-model/src/narrative.ts` (template bank) | ✅ |
| 5 | Non-obvious intellectual lineages? | `IdentityCoreSchema.intellectual_lineage` field | `packages/schema/src/identity.ts` | ⚠️ Schema exists; not surfaced in UI |
| 6 | Strategic differentiators overlooked? | `IdentityCoreSchema.strategic_differentiators` field | `packages/schema/src/identity.ts` | ⚠️ Schema exists; not surfaced in UI |
| 7 | Modular/mask-based identity components? | Full mask system with 16 masks, 3 ontologies, activation rules | `packages/schema/src/mask.ts`, `packages/content-model/src/mask-selection.ts` | ✅ |
| 8 | Skeptic challenges and counter-evidence? | VC verification + narrative `evidence` blocks + proof points | `packages/core/src/vc.ts`, `packages/content-model/src/narrative.ts` | ✅ |

### 1.3 Problem Statement & Dignity (FOUND-005 + COVENANT §II + GENESIS)

| Promise | Implementation | Evidence | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Documented failure (2000 apps → 0 interviews) | COVENANT §II frames the motivation | `docs/COVENANT.md` §II | ✅ Context |
| "You are not a resume. You are a complete human." | Dignity embedded in feature design, not stated in UI | — | ⚠️ See G6 |
| Inverting the power dynamic | Inverted Interview + Hunter Protocol + mutual evaluation | `apps/api/src/routes/interviews.ts`, `packages/core/src/hunter-protocol/` | ✅ |
| "We do not reform this system. We replace it." | System provides alternative paradigm, not incremental fix | Architecture is ground-up, not a resume builder plugin | ✅ |
| Three-fold completeness (masks + places + things) | Masks (16) × Scaenae (6) × CVEntryTypes (11) | Schema, taxonomy, API routes | ✅ |

### 1.4 Inverted Interview Vision (PLAN-008)

The standalone `docs/INVERTED-INTERVIEW.md` (449 lines) envisions a theatrical two-act structure with real-time LLM analysis.

| Promise | Implementation | Evidence | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Act I: Interviewer becomes interviewee | Interview session with questions posed to employer | `apps/api/src/routes/interviews.ts`, `InvertedInterviewInterface.tsx` | ✅ |
| Act II: Requirements appear "from the sides of the stage" | Job requirements injected into analysis | `packages/core/src/hunter-protocol/compatibility-analyzer.ts` | ⚠️ Batch, not theatrical |
| Real-time tone analysis | Not implemented — answers recorded, not analyzed for tone | — | ❌ |
| Dynamic mask triggering based on interviewer needs | Masks are statically selected | `apps/web/src/components/MaskSelector.tsx` | ❌ |
| 5-factor compatibility scoring | Compatibility via `CompatibilityAnalyzer` with fit_score | `packages/core/src/hunter-protocol/compatibility-analyzer.ts` | ⚠️ Simplified |
| Live dashboard with red/green flags | Static results page post-completion | `InvertedInterviewInterface.tsx` | ⚠️ Post-hoc |
| System-generated follow-up questions | Not implemented — questions are static | — | ❌ See G9 |
| Compensation analysis against market rate | Not implemented | — | ❌ |

### 1.5 Genesis Document (CONVERSATION-COVENANT-GENESIS)

The genesis conversation records the philosophical arc from "imagine..." to technical architecture. Key promises not captured elsewhere:

| Promise | Implementation | Evidence | Status |
|---------|---------------|----------|--------|
| Theatrical self-awareness as political act | Schema uses Latin terminology; system acknowledges performance | `nomen`, `motto` fields in mask/persona schemas | ✅ In schema |
| "Nothing broken, everything clarified" | Infrastructure aligns with applications | Consistent schema → API → UI flow | ✅ |
| Application spam prevention through Hunter filtering | Hunter Protocol filters opportunities before applying | `packages/core/src/hunter-protocol/` | ✅ |
| Recognize transfer skills (e.g., mother = operations manager) | Multi-dimensional mask system can surface cross-domain skills | `CVEntrySchema` with custom types, mask filtering | ✅ Enabled |

---

## 2. Ontological Taxonomy (SPEC-003)

### 2.1 Masks — 16/16 ✅

All 16 masks from SPEC-003 are implemented with full activation rules, filters, and stylistic parameters.

| # | Mask | Ontology | Evidence |
|---|------|----------|----------|
| 1 | Analyst | Cognitive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[0]` in `packages/content-model/src/taxonomy.ts` |
| 2 | Synthesist | Cognitive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[1]` |
| 3 | Observer | Cognitive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[2]` |
| 4 | Strategist | Cognitive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[3]` |
| 5 | Speculator | Cognitive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[4]` |
| 6 | Interpreter | Expressive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[5]` |
| 7 | Artisan | Expressive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[6]` |
| 8 | Architect | Expressive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[7]` |
| 9 | Narrator | Expressive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[8]` |
| 10 | Provoker | Expressive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[9]` |
| 11 | Mediator | Expressive | `MASK_TAXONOMY[10]` |
| 12 | Executor | Operational | `MASK_TAXONOMY[11]` |
| 13 | Steward | Operational | `MASK_TAXONOMY[12]` |
| 14 | Integrator | Operational | `MASK_TAXONOMY[13]` |
| 15 | Custodian | Operational | `MASK_TAXONOMY[14]` |
| 16 | Calibrator | Operational | `MASK_TAXONOMY[15]` |

**Schema richness**: Each mask includes `id`, `name`, `nomen` (Latin), `role_vector`, `tone_register`, `motto`, `ontology`, `functional_scope`, `stylistic_parameters` (tone, rhetorical_mode, compression_ratio), `activation_rules`, `filters`, and optional `redaction` rules.

### 2.2 Personalities — 9/9 ⚠️

All 9 defined, but with thin schema. See **G1**.

Evidence: `packages/schema/src/personality.ts`, `PERSONALITY_TAXONOMY` in `packages/content-model/src/taxonomy.ts`

### 2.3 Stages — 8/8 ✅

## 8. Archived Originals vs. Consolidated Summaries

The `CONSOLIDATED-SPECIFICATIONS.md` compresses the original FOUND/SPEC/ARCH/ORCH/META/PLAN series into a single 787-line reference. Key observations from comparing originals to consolidated:

### Context Preserved

- Blockchain-CV analogy (FOUND-001 → §1.1): Core thesis intact
- Eight identity questions (FOUND-004 → §1.2): All 8 questions preserved
- Mask taxonomy (SPEC-003 → §3): All 16 masks with full detail
- Agent registry (SPEC-004 → §5.2): All 5 core roles preserved
- Orchestration loop (ORCH-002 → §5.4): Sense-Plan-Act-Critique intact

### Context Compressed or Lost

| Original | What was compressed | Impact |
|----------|-------------------|--------|
| FOUND-002 | Four-layer blockchain stack (DID/VC/SBT/Portfolio) with env placeholders | Lost pluggability emphasis |
| FOUND-003 | Latin etymology deep dive (persona principalis, deus ex machina rejection) | Persona principalis concept underemphasized |
| FOUND-005 | Eight research domain prompts as modular agent instructions | Research modularity not visible |
| META-001 | "Identity OS" framing; five major systems with verification as 5th | "Identity OS" vision less prominent |
| META-004 | Long-term trajectory toward "Personal Operating System for Work History" | Category-defining ambition compressed |
| ORCH-001 | Six operating principles + continuation hooks + authority boundaries | Agent protocol detail lost |
| PLAN-001/002 | 37 EU total effort across 7 phases; 100% budget allocation | Planning detail not referenced |

### Philosophical Elements Unique to Originals

These ideas appear in the originals but not in `CONSOLIDATED-SPECIFICATIONS.md`:

1. **Persona principalis** (FOUND-003) — The underlying actor beneath all masks. Schema supports it via `IdentityCoreSchema`, but the term and its implications aren't operationalized.

2. **"Identity OS" vision** (META-001, META-004) — The system evolving from CV tool to a sovereign identity operating system powering all professional representations. Current architecture supports this trajectory.

3. **Agent continuation hooks** (ORCH-001) — Agents should emit "next-step affordances" after completing tasks, creating a proactive suggestion loop. Not implemented (agents are reactive, not proactive).

4. **Eight research domains as callable services** (FOUND-005) — Identity, Product, Architecture, Schema, Positioning, Masks, Lineage, Cost — each delegable to an independent agent. Partially realized through 10-agent system.

## 9. Gap Register

### G1: PersonalitySchema Underdeveloped ([#24](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/24))

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Seed Source**: SPEC-003 (9 personalities with rich descriptions implying capability profiles)
- **Current State**: `PersonalitySchema` has only `id`, `label`, `orientation`, `summary` — 4 fields
- **Contrast**: `ScaenaSchema` has 10+ fields including audience, formality, visibility, activities, tone
- **Recommendation**: Extend with `capability_profile`, `strengths`, `weaknesses`, `complementary_masks`

### G2: SettingSchema Minimal ([#25](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/25))

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Seed Source**: SPEC-003 (8 settings providing environmental context)
- **Current State**: 4 fields (`id`, `title`, `summary`, `tags`) vs. ScaenaSchema's 10+
- **Recommendation**: Extend with `audience`, `formality`, `tone_expectations`, `typical_constraints`

### G3: COVENANT Persona Names Not Operationalized ([#26](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/26))

- **Severity**: Low
- **Seed Source**: COVENANT §III-A (Persona Sapiens, Mechanica, Fabulator, Synthesist, Errans, Soror/Frater)
- **Current State**: 16 functional masks exist but COVENANT's 6 Latin personas not seeded as canonical `TabulaPersonarumEntry` instances
- **Recommendation**: Seed 6 entries with COVENANT names as `nomen`, mapping to mask combinations

### G4: MaskSelector Hardcodes 4 Masks ([#27](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/27))

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Seed Source**: SPEC-003 (16 masks available)
- **Current State**: `MaskSelector.tsx` exposes only analyst, artisan, architect, strategist (4/16)
- **Note**: `PersonaeSelector.tsx` and `TabulaPersonarum.tsx` are dynamic — this gap is specific to `MaskSelector`
- **Recommendation**: Make dynamic or replace with `PersonaeSelector`

### G5: Theatrical Language Not Surfaced in UI ([#28](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/28))

- **Severity**: Low
- **Seed Source**: FOUND-003 (theatrum mundi, persona principalis), COVENANT §IX
- **Current State**: Schema has `nomen`, `latin_name`, `motto`; UI uses English labels
- **Recommendation**: Surface `nomen`/`motto` in persona cards; consider theatrical mode toggle

### G6: No Explicit Dignity Statement in UI ([#29](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/29))

- **Severity**: Low
- **Seed Source**: COVENANT §XII–XIV, GENESIS ("You are not a resume. You are a complete human.")
- **Current State**: Dignity embedded in design but not visible as mission statement
- **Recommendation**: Extend about page with COVENANT dignity statements

### G7: Identity Invariants Not Persisted ([#30](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/30))

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Seed Source**: FOUND-004 (8 identity questions), SPEC-001 (IdentityCore interface), FOUND-003 (persona principalis)
- **Current State**: `IdentityCoreSchema` exists with 7 fields but no dedicated DB table
- **Recommendation**: Add `identity_core` table or JSON column on profiles

### G8: Mask Matching Not Unified ([#31](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/31))

- **Severity**: Low
- **Seed Source**: SPEC-002 (single coherent mask filtering system)
- **Current State**: Basic in `core/maskMatching.ts`, sophisticated in `content-model/mask-selection.ts`
- **Recommendation**: Deprecate simpler version, re-export from content-model

### G9: Interview Questions Hardcoded ([#32](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/32))

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Seed Source**: COVENANT §VIII, PLAN-008 (12 strategic questions + system-generated follow-ups)
- **Current State**: 9 static questions in API, 5 in UI. No gap-based follow-up generation.
- **Recommendation**: LLM-powered question generation from profile/job context, with static fallback

### ~~G10: Blockchain/Wallet/SBT Not Implemented~~ ([#33](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/33)) — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Deferred (by design)~~ → Resolved
- **Seed Source**: FOUND-002, SPEC-001, COVENANT §XI
- **Resolution**: Full ERC-5192 Soulbound Token integration via `viem`. SBT schema (`SoulboundTokenSchema`, `WalletConnectionSchema`, `SBTMintRequestSchema`), EVM interaction layer (`SBTService` with mint/burn/query + dry-run mode), API routes (`POST /attestations/:id/mint-sbt`, `GET /sbt/:addr`, `POST /wallet/connect`), Postgres migration (019), MetaMask wallet connection UI, verification page at `/profile/:id/verification`. Target: Sepolia testnet. See ADR-014.
- **Files**: `packages/schema/src/verification.ts`, `packages/core/src/evm/`, `apps/api/src/routes/sbt.ts`, `apps/api/src/repositories/sbt-tokens.ts`, `apps/web/src/components/WalletConnect.tsx`, `apps/web/src/app/profile/[profileId]/verification/page.tsx`
- **Tests**: 33 new tests (14 schema + 19 EVM)

### ~~G11: Real-Time Interview Analysis ([#34](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/34))~~ — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Medium~~ **None**
- **Seed Source**: PLAN-008 (Act II staging, live compatibility, tone analysis)
- **Resolution**: Incremental compatibility scoring runs after each answer (2+ answers), published via PubSub `interviewScoreUpdated` events. GraphQL subscriptions `interviewScoreUpdated(sessionId)` and `interviewCompleted(sessionId)` added. `ToneAnalyzer` (keyword-based, Strategy pattern) auto-detects answer tone (defensive/neutral/transparent/enthusiastic). Sessions persisted to Postgres via `InterviewSessionRepo` (migration 018). Live dashboard at `/interview/[profileId]/live` with SVG score gauge, category breakdown bars, and answer feed with tone indicators. WebSocket subscription hook (`useInterviewSubscription`) with REST polling fallback.

### G12: Dynamic Mask Triggering From Interview ([#35](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/35))

- **Severity**: Low
- **Seed Source**: PLAN-008 §"The Masks Respond Dynamically"
- **Current State**: Masks selected manually, not triggered by interviewer answers
- **Recommendation**: Wire `selectBestMask()` to interview answer analysis

### ~~G13: Custom User-Created Masks ([#36](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/36))~~ — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Low~~ **None**
- **Seed Source**: ADR-005 (promises user-created masks in Phase 2)
- **Resolution**: Admin mask management page (`/admin/masks`) with full CRUD via `MaskEditor`. `MaskSelector` now fetches custom masks from API alongside predefined taxonomy. Admin layout with cross-page navigation added.

### G14: Hunter Protocol Provider Implementations ([#37](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/37))

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Seed Source**: ADR-008 (pluggable job search providers)
- **Current State**: Only `MockJobSearchProvider` confirmed; Serper/real provider status unclear
- **Recommendation**: Implement at least one real job board provider (Indeed, LinkedIn, Serper)

### ~~G15: Agent Stub Executors (No Real Autonomy)~~ ([#38](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/issues/38)) — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Low (architectural placeholder)~~ → Resolved
- **Seed Source**: ORCH-001 (6 operating principles including Initiative), ORCH-002 (Sense-Plan-Act loop)
- **Resolution**: Per-role `LocalLLMExecutor` instances replace `StubExecutor` when Ollama is available. Each of the 10 roles gets a restricted `ShellToolRunner` with allowlisted commands per `ROLE_TOOL_DEFINITIONS` (e.g., architect: read-only + tsc; implementer: write + lint; narrator: text-only). `createLLMAgents()` provides graceful degradation — falls back to `StubExecutor` when LLM config is disabled or unreachable. The existing `invokeStructured()` ReAct loop (LLM → tool call → result → re-prompt) handles the Sense-Plan-Act cycle. See ADR-013.
- **Files**: `apps/orchestrator/src/tool-definitions.ts`, `apps/orchestrator/src/react-loop.ts`, `apps/orchestrator/src/agents.ts`
- **Tests**: 25 new tests in `test/tool-definitions.test.ts` (13) and `test/react-loop.test.ts` (12)

## 10. Phase Completion & Roadmap Audit

This section extends the audit to cover 74 documents not included in the original §1-§9 analysis: phase completion reports, roadmap documents, forward commitment documents, feature documentation, root-level READMEs, .github/ documents, and archived status/completion documents.

### 10.1 Phase Completion Reports — Deep Verification

Five CRITICAL documents were verified by spot-checking 3 representative claims each against the actual codebase.

#### PHASE-9-COMPLETION.md (537 lines)

| Claim | Evidence Check | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `PersonaCollaborationCard.tsx` (~300 lines) | File exists, 285 lines, feedback request UI | ✅ Confirmed |
| `messaging.ts` API routes (400+ lines) | File exists, 445 lines, 6 route handlers with Zod validation | ✅ Confirmed |
| OAuth 2.0 in `developer-api.ts` | File exists, 546 lines, OAuth app/authorize/token endpoints | ✅ Confirmed |

**Caveat**: All Phase 9 routes use in-memory `Map` storage, not PostgreSQL. Functionally complete but not production-persistent.

#### PHASE-ROADMAP.md (712 lines)

| Claim | Evidence Check | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| `OnboardingWizard.tsx` exists | File exists, 487 lines, 7-step guided experience | ✅ Confirmed |
| Stripe integration in `billing.ts` | File exists, 450 lines, BillingService + Stripe env vars | ✅ Confirmed |
| `packages/design-system/` with components | Package exists, 34 components, Storybook, React 19 peers | ✅ Confirmed |

#### FEATURE-AUDIT.md (259 lines)

| Claim | Evidence Check | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| "All features implemented, 3 minor gaps" | Gaps: account lockout, CSRF (N/A for JWT), did:ethr→did:pkh | ✅ Accurate within scope |
| Scope: 33-conversation spec-to-code audit | Covers seed.yaml, CONSOLIDATED-SPECIFICATIONS.md | ✅ Correct |
| Gap count vs SEED-ALIGNMENT (3 vs 15) | Different scopes: functional vs philosophical | ⚠️ Not contradictory |

**Key finding**: FEATURE-AUDIT is technically accurate but narrowly scoped. This audit's 15 gaps (G1-G15) cover philosophy-to-code alignment that FEATURE-AUDIT explicitly excludes.

#### PLAN-PHASE-1-MONETIZATION.md (142 lines)

| Claim | Evidence Check | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Stripe billing in `billing.ts` | BillingService with Stripe config, checkout, webhooks | ✅ Confirmed |
| Feature gating middleware | `middleware/feature-gate.ts` (205 lines), 6 feature keys | ✅ Confirmed |
| Pricing page | `apps/web/src/app/pricing/page.tsx` (180 lines), 3 tiers | ✅ Confirmed |

#### PHASE-9-PLAN.md (462 lines)

| Claim | Evidence Check | Verdict |
|-------|---------------|---------|
| Community routes | No `community.ts`; split across messaging.ts, public-profiles.ts | ⚠️ Partial |
| Marketplace code | Zero matches for "marketplace" in codebase | ❌ Not found |
| Community UI components | CommunityBadges.tsx (328), CommunityLeaderboard.tsx (282), MentorProfiles.tsx (339) | ✅ Confirmed |

**8-epic assessment**: Epics 1-3, 6 implemented; Epic 4 partial (UI only); Epic 5 schema only; Epic 7-8 unverified.

### 10.2 Phase Completion Reports — Spot Checks

Nine HIGH-risk documents were verified with 1 representative claim each.

| Document | Lines | Claim Checked | Verdict |
|----------|-------|--------------|---------|
| PHASE-6-COMPLETION.md | 755 | HunterAgent 4 core methods | ✅ All 5 methods verified in `hunter-agent.ts` |
| PHASE-7-SUMMARY.md | 467 | "8-stage CI/CD pipeline" | ⚠️ Only 5 jobs in `ci-cd.yml`; deploy stages missing |
| PHASE-8-SUMMARY.md | 710 | OnboardingWizard (500+ lines, 7 steps) | ✅ 487 lines, 7-step flow confirmed |
| PHASE-7-DEPLOYMENT.md | 817 | 7 K8s manifests, API replicas=3 | ✅ All manifests exist in `infra/k8s/base/` |
| PHASE-1-SECURITY-AUDIT.md | 132 | `createOwnershipMiddleware()` | ✅ Lines 116-147 in `auth.ts`, applied in billing.ts |
| ACCESSIBILITY.md | 450 | WCAG 2.1 AA with skip links, focus mgmt | ❌ Minimal — only basic aria attributes found |
| SECURITY.md | 659 | OWASP Top 10 with security headers "Ready" | ⚠️ Core mitigations present; helmet middleware missing |
| OPERATIONS.md | 763 | Prometheus alerts + Grafana dashboards | ✅ 10+ alerts, 4 dashboards (112KB total) |
| ARTIFACT_SYSTEM_DEPLOYMENT.md | 794 | "All 4 workstreams implemented" | ⚠️ API/UI/DB exist; LLM classification not verified |

### 10.3 Forward Commitment Tracking

| WCAG Criterion | Claimed | Verified |
|---------------|---------|----------|
| 2.4.1 Bypass Blocks (skip nav) | ✅ | ❌ No skip links found |

## 14. Expanded Gap Register (G16-G25)

Gap types: **-D** = Drift, **-C** = Commitment, **-S** = Staleness

### ~~G16-D: Phase 9 Community Marketplace Not Implemented~~ — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Medium~~ **None**
- **Source**: `docs/phases/PHASE-9-PLAN.md` (Epic 4: marketplace functionality)
- **Resolution**: Minimum Viable Marketplace implemented: `packages/schema/src/marketplace.ts` (Zod schemas for listings, reviews, imports), `apps/api/migrations/020_marketplace.sql` (3 tables with GIN indexes), `apps/api/src/repositories/marketplace.ts` (InMemory + Postgres repos), `apps/api/src/routes/marketplace.ts` (CRUD + search/filter/sort + reviews + imports), `apps/web/src/app/marketplace/` (browse grid + detail page with reviews), "Publish to Marketplace" button in MaskEditor. Template sharing, ratings, search, and import functionality covers the core marketplace claim.

### ~~G17-D: CI/CD Pipeline Overstated in PHASE-7-SUMMARY~~ — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Low~~ **None**
- **Source**: `docs/phases/PHASE-7-SUMMARY.md` claims "8-stage pipeline"
- **Resolution**: `ci-cd.yml` actually has 8 stages (quality, test, security, build, deploy-staging, smoke-tests, deploy-production, notify). The claim is accurate.

### ~~G18-C: WCAG 2.1 AA Commitment Unvalidated~~ — RESOLVED

- **Severity**: ~~Medium~~ **None**
- **Source**: `docs/ACCESSIBILITY.md` claims WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- **Resolution**: Critical-path WCAG 2.1 AA implemented: skip-to-main link, `:focus-visible` outlines, Modal focus trap + `aria-labelledby`, Tabs arrow-key navigation with roving tabindex, Dropdown keyboard support (Arrow/Escape/focus management), `prefers-reduced-motion` media query, `--ds-focus-ring` / `--ds-text-secondary` tokens, ACCESSIBILITY.md updated from "aspirational" to implementation status.

### G19-C: Security Headers Middleware Missing

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Source**: `docs/SECURITY.md` lists security headers as "Ready"
- **Current State**: No helmet or explicit security header middleware in `apps/api/src/index.ts`; WebSocket auth incomplete
- **Recommendation**: Add `@fastify/helmet` or equivalent; document WebSocket auth gap

### G20-S: Duplicate Architecture Diagrams Documents -- RESOLVED

- **Severity**: Low
- **Source**: `docs/ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAMS.md` (239 lines, hyphenated) was a duplicate of `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md` (625 lines, underscored)
- **Resolution**: Shorter duplicate deleted during docs reorganization. Only `docs/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAMS.md` remains.

### G21-S: 16 Archived Files Without Staleness Banners

- **Severity**: Low
- **Source**: `docs/archived/` — see §12.1
- **Current State**: 16 files claim "COMPLETE" or "PRODUCTION READY" without ⚠️ ARCHIVED banners
- **Recommendation**: Add staleness banners pointing to `docs/FEATURE-AUDIT.md` for current state

### G22-D: FEATURE-AUDIT Gap Count vs SEED-ALIGNMENT Scope Mismatch

- **Severity**: Low (informational)
- **Source**: FEATURE-AUDIT reports 3 gaps; SEED-ALIGNMENT reports 15+ gaps
- **Current State**: Different scopes — functional vs philosophical — but this isn't documented
- **Recommendation**: Add cross-reference paragraph to FEATURE-AUDIT explaining scope difference

### G23-S: packages/core/README.md Is a 3-Line Stub

- **Severity**: Low
- **Source**: `packages/core/README.md` — "Core Package / Holds core domain logic."
- **Current State**: 3 lines; no API docs, no usage examples, no architecture description
- **Recommendation**: Expand with package exports, usage patterns, and module structure

### G24-D: .github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md References Deleted Workflow

- **Severity**: Low
- **Source**: `.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` line 12 references `ci.yml` as "Legacy CI workflow"
- **Current State**: `ci.yml` was deleted; canonical workflow is `test.yml` (renamed to "CI")
- **Recommendation**: Update to reflect current workflow files

### G25-C: Artifact System Cloud Storage Promises

- **Severity**: Medium
- **Source**: `docs/features/artifact-system/ARTIFACT_SYSTEM_USER_GUIDE.md` §"Connecting Cloud Storage" and DEPLOYMENT.md
- **Current State**: Integration routes exist (`integrations.ts`, `artifacts.ts`) but LLM-based classification pipeline not verified as functional
- **Recommendation**: Verify CatcherAgent classification works end-to-end or document as partial

| **G14** | Real job search provider | 4-6 hours |
| ~~**G15**~~ | ~~Connect agents to LLM executor~~ | ~~RESOLVED~~ |
| ~~**G13**~~ | ~~Custom mask creation~~ | ~~RESOLVED~~ |
| ~~**G10**~~ | ~~Blockchain/SBT integration~~ | ~~RESOLVED~~ |

### Priority 6 — Expanded Audit Gaps (G16-G25)

| Gap | Action | Effort | Type |
|-----|--------|--------|------|
| ~~**G16-D**~~ | ~~Implement community marketplace or downgrade Phase 9 claims~~ | ~~RESOLVED~~ | Drift |
| **G17-D** | Update PHASE-7-SUMMARY CI/CD pipeline description | 30 min | Drift |
| ~~**G18-C**~~ | ~~WCAG 2.1 AA critical-path~~ | ~~RESOLVED~~ | Commitment |
| **G19-C** | Add `@fastify/helmet`; document WebSocket auth gap | 2-3 hours | Commitment |
| **G20-S** | ~~Delete `ARCHITECTURE-DIAGRAMS.md`~~ **DONE** | — | Staleness |
| **G21-S** | Add staleness banners to 16 archived files | 1-2 hours | Staleness |
| **G22-D** | Add scope-difference note to FEATURE-AUDIT.md | 15 min | Drift |
| **G23-S** | Expand `packages/core/README.md` with exports & usage | 1 hour | Staleness |
| **G24-D** | Update `.github/GITHUB_ACTIONS_SETUP.md` workflow refs | 15 min | Drift |
| **G25-C** | Verify artifact LLM classification pipeline or document partial | 4-6 hours | Commitment |

**Effort summary for G16-G25**: ~70-95 hours total, but most quick-win items (G17, G20, G22, G24) can be batched in a single commit (< 1 hour).

---

## 16. Cross-Reference with FEATURE-AUDIT.md

- **FEATURE-AUDIT** answers: "Does the code implement what the specs describe?" (functional completeness)
- **SEED-ALIGNMENT-AUDIT** answers: "Does the code honor the vision, ontology, and promises of the founding documents?" (philosophical alignment)

No contradictions found. Where FEATURE-AUDIT marks `✅ COMPLETE`, this audit confirms philosophical intent is preserved. The original 15 gaps (G1-G15) are areas where implementation is *functionally correct* but *ontologically thinner* or *aspirationally incomplete* relative to the seeds.

**Key correction from expanded audit**: Several items initially flagged as gaps (Aetas timeline, MermaidView, KeyExportModal, AttestationBlock, agent-to-agent API) turned out to be **already implemented** — the EVOLUTION-PLAN's `[x]` markers were accurate.

### Scope Reconciliation

| Dimension | FEATURE-AUDIT | SEED-ALIGNMENT-AUDIT |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------|
| **Scope** | Specs → Code | Founding vision → Code |
| **Gap count** | 3 functional gaps | 25 gaps (15 philosophical + 10 expanded) |
| **Overlap** | None — different lenses | G22-D documents this mismatch |
| **Document coverage** | ~20 spec documents | 129 documents (full corpus) |
| **Verdict type** | ✅/⚠️/❌ per feature | ✅ Aligned / ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Drift per document |

FEATURE-AUDIT's 3 gaps concern missing *features*; this audit's 25 gaps concern missing *depth*, *forward commitments*, and *documentation freshness*. Together they provide complementary coverage: functional correctness (FEATURE-AUDIT) and philosophical fidelity (SEED-ALIGNMENT-AUDIT).

---

## 17. Conclusion

Across **129 documents** — 30 archived originals, 42 non-archived docs, 12 ADRs, 13 app/package READMEs, 3 .github files, and 29 root/infra/scripts files — the implementation demonstrates strong philosophical alignment with meaningful gaps in forward commitments and documentation freshness.

### Summary Statistics

| Metric | Count |
|--------|-------|
| Total documents audited | 129 |
| Tier 1 (deep verified, 3+ claims) | 5 |
| Tier 2 (spot-checked, 1+ claim) | 9 |
| Tier 3 (classified) | 115 |
| Gaps registered (G1-G25) | 25 |
| Gap severity: High | 3 (~~G10~~, ~~G16~~, ~~G18~~ — all RESOLVED) |
| Gap severity: Medium | 9 |
| Gap severity: Low | 13 |
| GitHub issues created | #24-#38 (G1-G15), #39-#48 (G16-G25) |
| Documents with staleness concerns | 22 |
| Forward commitments unvalidated | 3 (G18, G19, G25) |

### Key Findings

- **Core thesis** (blockchain-CV analogy, mask-based identity, mutual evaluation) is fully realized in code
- **Ontological taxonomy** (16 masks, 9 personalities, 8 stages, 8 epochs, 8 settings, 6 scaenae) is complete with relationship maps
- **12 ADRs** show 9 fully aligned, 3 partially aligned, 0 contradicted
- **COVENANT commitments** (6 core + designer/user/system) are all honored
- **Phase completion reports** (6-9) are largely accurate — Phase 9 marketplace now implemented via Minimum Viable Marketplace (G16-D RESOLVED)
- **Forward commitments** in ACCESSIBILITY.md and SECURITY.md exceed current implementation (G18-C, G19-C)
- **22 documents** have staleness concerns (outdated references, missing banners, or stale completion claims)
- **0 contradictions** between FEATURE-AUDIT and SEED-ALIGNMENT-AUDIT

### Risk Assessment

| Risk Level | Description | Action Required |
|------------|-------------|-----------------|
| **None** | Core identity system, schema, masks, narrative engine | Maintain |
| **Low** | Documentation freshness, stubs, duplicate files | Batch cleanup |
| **Medium** | Security headers, artifact pipeline, CI/CD docs | Targeted fixes |
| **High** | WCAG commitment, Phase 9 marketplace claims | Reclassify or implement |

The system translates its philosophical DNA into working software. The original seeds envisioned an "Identity OS" — the current implementation is a strong foundation toward that vision, with the 25 registered gaps being refinements, documentation hygiene, and forward-commitment validation rather than structural failures.
