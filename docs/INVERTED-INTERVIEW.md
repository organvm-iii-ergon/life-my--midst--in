## Concept

You share a link. When an employer/partner visits, **they answer your questions**. Their answers—combined with job requirements that **appear from the sides of the stage** (injected into the system)—are analyzed against your profiles, masks, and growth objectives.

**You** become the evaluator. **They** prove fit.

## Stage Design

### Act I: The Interviewer Becomes Interviewee

**When an employer lands on your link:**

## Real-Time Compatibility Analysis

### The System Evaluates:

**1. Skill-to-Role Mapping**
```
Their Requirements vs. Your Capabilities
├─ TypeScript: You (Expert) vs. Role (Expert) ✅ Perfect match
├─ React: You (Advanced) vs. Role (Advanced) ✅ Perfect match  
├─ Leadership: You (Developing) vs. Role (Required) ⚠️  Gap exists
└─ Compatibility Score: 85%
```

**2. Values Alignment**
```
What They Said               What Your Profile Says
├─ "High trust culture"      You value autonomy ✅
├─ "Chaos/iterative"         You prefer structure ⚠️
├─ "Mission-driven"          You seek impact ✅
├─ "Growth-oriented"         You're learning-focused ✅
└─ Values Match: 78%
```

**3. Growth Projection**
```
18-month Growth They Offer vs. Your Trajectory
├─ Technical: TypeScript → Rust? (Your goal: Go)
├─ Leadership: IC → Manager (Your path: Architect)
├─ Domain: Web → Systems (Aligned? Tangential?)
└─ Growth Fit: 62% (Partial alignment)
```

**4. Sustainability Score**
```
Can you sustain 2 features/week?
├─ Your velocity: 1.8 features/week (baseline)
├─ Context overhead: 15% (new team/codebase)
├─ Predicted: 1.53 features/week
└─ Sustainability: ⚠️ TIGHT (90% of requirement)
```

**5. Compensation Analysis**
```
What They Offer vs. Market + Your Value
├─ Base: $180k (market avg for your skills: $190k)
├─ Equity: 20% (??? - need to ask: vesting, strike price)
├─ Total Value: ~$240k/year (if exit in 5 years)
├─ Your Minimum: $200k
└─ Offer Assessment: ⚠️ BELOW THRESHOLD
```

## The Masks Respond Dynamically

### Different Requirements Trigger Different Perspectives

**If they need: "Quick-shipping pragmatist"**
→ Your **Artisan mask** surfaces
```
"I can ship MVP features in 2-week sprints
and iterate based on user feedback. I'm comfortable
with technical debt when it unlocks learning."
```

**If they need: "Architectural thinker"**
→ Your **Architect mask** surfaces
```
"I design for scalability and ask 'what's the long-term
cost of this decision?' I can balance pragmatism
with thoughtful design."
```

**If they need: "Team builder"**
→ Your **Synthesist mask** surfaces
```
"I help teams understand each other's perspectives.
I can mentor emerging engineers while shipping features."
```

The interviewer sees not just your skills, but **which aspect of you fits their needs.**

## The Questions You Ask Them

### Strategic Interviewing (You → Them)

**On Culture & Values:**
- "Describe a time you made a decision that prioritized people over metrics."
- "When was the last time you changed your mind about something important?"
- "What does psychological safety mean to you?"

**On Growth:**
- "What's the steepest learning curve someone on your team has climbed?"
- "How many people from this role have been promoted? Where?"
- "What skills would you want your hire to develop in the first year?"

**On Sustainability:**
- "What's a mistake you've made in hiring that resulted in burnout?"
- "How do you measure success here? Can someone hit those metrics long-term?"
- "What's your team's turnover rate, and why?"

**On Authenticity:**
- "Tell me about a hire that looked perfect on paper but was a terrible fit."
- "What would make someone miserable in this role?"
- "If I failed at this, what would that failure look like?"

---

## Strategic Advantages

### For You (The Candidate)

1. **Information Asymmetry Reversal**
   - You gain intelligence before they do
   - You see their values, not just their claims
   - You evaluate compatibility on YOUR terms

2. **Power Dynamics**
   - They're now the ones trying to impress
   - You can ask hard questions
   - You set the tone: transparent, values-driven

3. **Data-Driven Decisions**
   - System gives you compatibility scores
   - Identifies red flags AND green flags
   - Prevents costly mis-hires (from your side)

4. **Negotiating Position**
   - You know their constraints before negotiating
   - You can identify where they're lowballing
   - You're evaluating them as much as they evaluate you

### For Them (The Employer)

1. **See Your Real Self**
   - Not a polished answer to their questions
   - Your actual values and thinking emerge
   - They see if you're genuinely a fit

2. **Faster Screening**
   - System flags incompatibilities early
   - They can pivot if you're not right
   - They avoid hiring mistakes

3. **Better Collaboration**
   - You're both entering eyes open
   - Less chance of "culture shock" post-hire
   - You're both choosing consciously

---

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

**1. Interview Interface** (`apps/web/src/app/interview/[profileId]/page.tsx`)
- Dynamic question generation based on role/profile
- Real-time tone analysis
- Video/audio recording (optional)
- Streaming responses to LLM for analysis

**2. Job Requirements Injection** (`apps/api/src/routes/interviews.ts`)
- Receive job posting data from employer's system
- Validate and normalize requirements
- Inject into analysis engine

**3. Compatibility Engine** (`packages/content-model/src/compatibility.ts`)
- Multi-factor analysis:
  - Skill matching
  - Values alignment
  - Growth projection
  - Sustainability scoring
  - Compensation analysis
  - Mask resonance

**4. Real-Time Dashboard** (`apps/web/src/components/CompatibilityDashboard.tsx`)
- Live scoring during interview
- Visual compatibility indicators
- Flag system for red/green flags
- Recommended next steps

**5. Persistent Store** (`apps/api/src/repositories/interviews.ts`)
- Interview responses
- Compatibility scores
- Comparative analysis (if they interview multiple people)
- Historical patterns

---

## Privacy & Consent

### Data Handling

- Interviewer sees: Your profile, masks, questions responses
- You see: Their answers, requirements, compatibility scores
- Both parties consent before questions are asked
- Clear data usage policies

### Optional Features

- Anonymized mode (you see compatibility without knowing company)
- Question customization (add your own questions)
- Private vs. public interviews
- NDA gating for sensitive information

---

## Future Extensions

### Multi-Party Interviews
- Interview multiple candidates simultaneously
- See comparative fit scores
- Team members answer different question sets
- Collective compatibility analysis

### Reverse Interviews
- Candidate link → they interview candidates
- Standardized but personalized questionnaires
- Comparative analysis across candidates
- Reduces bias in hiring

### Organization Profiles
- Companies create profiles (like you did)
- Show your organizational DNA
- Teams link to their org profile
- Candidates see org-level values before applying

### Negotiation Assistance
- System suggests leverage points
- Analyzes offer vs. market + compatibility
- Recommends counter-offers
- Tracks negotiation history

---

## The Philosophical Shift

This inverts the power dynamic from:
- **"Convince us you're good"** → **"Prove you're worthy of my time"**
- **"Hidden criteria"** → **"Transparent requirements"**
- **"Hope it works out"** → **"Data-driven compatibility"**
- **"Asymmetric information"** → **"Mutual transparency"**

It's not adversarial. It's **collaborative evaluation** where both parties honestly assess fit before committing significant time and energy.

**You're not running away from interviews. You're running *toward* the right ones.**

---

## Example Scenario

### They Visit Your Link

1. **Landing**: "Hi, I'm interested in your profile. Can I ask you some questions?"
2. **Interview**: They answer your questions about culture, growth, sustainability
3. **Requirements**: Job posting auto-injected (or they manually enter details)
4. **Analysis**: System analyzes compatibility in real-time
5. **Feedback**: 
   - They see: "You're an 78% fit. Here's why."
   - You see: "This is a 72% opportunity. Consider asking about..."
6. **Next Steps**: If compatible, you both move to conversation phase

If incompatible:
- You politely decline (with reasons)
- They save time (no mismatched interview cycle)
- Both move on to better fits

Everyone wins.
