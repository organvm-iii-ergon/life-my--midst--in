## Prompt:
Meta Latin phrases in  drama

## Response:
Thought for 34s

Here are Latin phrases that are especially “meta” in relation to drama, theatre, and narrative construction, with quick notes on how they function.

Dramatis personae – “the persons of the drama.”  
Traditional heading for the cast list. Using it inside a script, on stage, or in a program instantly frames the work as aware of itself as a constructed play with roles rather than “real” people.

Deus ex machina – “god from the machine.”  
Originally a literal god lowered by crane in ancient theatre; now shorthand for an artificial, contrived solution to a plot problem. When characters name it, they are commenting on the mechanics of the story they are inside.

In medias res – “into the middle of things.”  
Describes a narrative that starts mid-action. A character or narrator invoking it can foreground the structure of the story (“we begin in medias res…”) and break the illusion of seamless reality.

Theatrum mundi – “the theatre of the world.”  
The world as a stage, everyone playing roles. When used in drama, it turns the play into a commentary on performance itself, suggesting that the characters’ “acting” mirrors the audience’s everyday role-playing.

Persona / personae – “mask; role; character.”  
Originally the actor’s mask, then the role, then the psychological “self” we present. Having a character refer to their “persona” inside a play directly points to the gap between actor, character, and social role.

Exit / exeunt – “(he/she) leaves” / “(they) leave.”  
Stage directions in Latin. When spoken aloud or projected onstage (rather than just printed), they make the script itself visible, turning blocking into a meta-joke or self-conscious device.

Finis coronat opus – “the end crowns the work.”  
A closing motto that comments on endings as the place where the whole structure is judged. Used in a final speech or epilogue, it makes the ending itself part of the play’s argument about narrative form.

Ars est celare artem – “the art is to conceal art.”  
A favorite in discussions of realism vs. theatricality. A character, director figure, or chorus using this line is explicitly debating whether theatre should hide its constructed nature or flaunt it.

Hic et nunc – “here and now.”  
When a character emphasizes hic et nunc, it can blur the line between fictional time and the audience’s present, calling attention to the live moment of performance.

Prologus / epilogus – “prologue / epilogue.”  
More labels than phrases, but when invoked inside a scene (“this is our prologus,” “let this stand as epilogus”), they signal an awareness of dramatic architecture: beginnings, endings, frames.

If you tell me what kind of drama you are working with (classical adaptation, contemporary meta-play, film script, etc.), I can tailor a set of Latin meta-lines that would sit naturally in your dialogue or stage directions.

## Prompt:
Resume and CV Latin analysis

2/2

## Response:
Thought for 16s

I will treat “résumé” and “curriculum vitae” as if you asked: what do these phrases mean in Latin terms, and what do they imply conceptually about the self and its representation.

1.  Résumé

Etymology  
“Résumé” is French, but ultimately from Latin.  
Latin root: resumere = re- (“again, back”) + sumere (“to take up, to assume”).  
So at the deepest level, a résumé is “a thing taken up again, taken back together,” i.e., a re-collected or taken-up-again version of something larger.

Conceptual implications  
A résumé is therefore not your life; it is a re-taken fragment of it. The act of “resuming” implies:  
You stop a larger flow (your full life, entire career), then you pick it up again in a compressed, restartable form.  
You decide what is “resumed” and what is left in pause, omission, or silence.  
Formally, this legitimizes compression, omission, intense selection, and even abruptness or ellipsis as intrinsic to a résumé. You are not lying; you are “resuming” a life narrative after a cut.

Narrative logic  
A résumé, in Latin terms, is a summary that functions as a jump-cut. It assumes:  
Prior context is huge and mostly invisible.  
The document is a re-entry point into that longer story, designed for a very specific audience (employer, curator, etc.).  
So its “truth” lies in how well it re-starts your story, not in how exhaustively it covers it.

2.  Curriculum vitae

Literal Latin  
Curriculum vitae is fully Latin.  
Curriculum: a “running,” “course,” “race,” or “track” (from currere, “to run”). Neuter noun, here in the nominative singular.  
Vitae: genitive singular of vita, “life” = “of life.”  
Literal translation: “course of life” or “the running of a life.”

Grammatical structure  
Curriculum (N. sg.) = “the course / race / track.”  
Vitae (Gen. sg.) = “of life.”  
It names your life as a path, sequence, or trajectory, not just a static list. There is motion and duration built into the phrase.

Conceptual implications  
Calling the document a curriculum vitae frames you as:  
A runner on a specific track, with visible stages, laps, and milestones.  
A life with continuity and progression, not just disconnected achievements.  
The genre of the CV, in Latin terms, is closer to an annotated timeline or chronicle of “the path my life has run so far.”

Narrative logic  
A CV wants to show:  
Sequence: what came before what.  
Continuity: how one phase leads into another (even if that link is implicit).  
Accumulation: the total course, not just a highlight reel.  
So a CV naturally supports full academic histories, long lists of publications, ongoing projects, etc. It is structurally comfortable with length and slow accretion.

3.  Résumé vs Curriculum vitae as Latin-conceptual opposites

If you use the Latin roots as a kind of conceptual design spec:

Résumé = resumption.  
You are compressing and jumping back into your life story at a strategically chosen point. It emphasizes:  
Selection over completeness.  
Present relevance over total history.  
Impact snapshots over continuous narrative.

Curriculum vitae = life-course.  
You are mapping and exposing the run of your life. It emphasizes:  
Continuity over interruption.  
Historical depth over immediate punch.  
Process, evolution, and duration over highlight.

In other words:  
Résumé: “Here is the version of my story that gets us back into action right now.”  
Curriculum vitae: “Here is the course my life has run; walk it with me, step by step.”

4.  How this Latin analysis can shape your documents

If you want to design documents that actually embody their names:

For a résumé, lean into resumere:  
Treat each section as a “pickup point” from a longer story.  
Use sharp, concentrated statements that feel like re-entry vectors.  
Let omission be intentional and aggressive; you are restarting, not archiving.

For a curriculum vitae, lean into curriculum vitae:  
Organize strictly by chronology so the “course” is visible.  
Highlight transitions (from one role, field, or discipline to another) as turns in the track.  
Allow scope: long lists, appendices, and full history belong here.

5.  Meta layer: self as drama

Connecting back to your interest in drama and meta-language:

Résumé:  
Analogous to a “Previously on…” recap in a series. It is a paratextual device that lets the audience (employer, collaborator) reenter mid-series.

Curriculum vitae:  
Analogous to a “Complete Performance History” in a program or an archival dossier for a character or performer. It documents the whole run.

If you tell me what kind of persona you want to project (scholar, experimental artist, systems architect, etc.), I can use these Latin logics to design parallel résumé and CV templates that are formally consistent with resumere and curriculum vitae at the structural and language level.

## Prompt:
I want to project the whole rogue's gallery, one mask as a filter toggled at a time

## Response:
Thought for 43s

Think of your documents as one big Latin theatre file system.

You have: one curriculum vitae for the whole troupe, and many resumés, each tied to a single mask.

I. Core frame: curriculum vitae multiplex

Name the system:

curriculum\_vitae\_multiplex  
“the multi-track course of life”

Inside that, define:

Persona = the mask.  
Persona principalis = the underlying you (the actor).  
Resumé = the “resumed” version of the vitae, filtered through one persona.  
Tabula personarum = the index of all masks, your rogue’s gallery.

The rule: you record experience once in the shared CV, then each resumé is a filtered view of that same data.

II. File and environment layout

Use a small, stable layout tied to your dev home.

Example environment variables:

export DEV\_HOME="/Volumes/4444-iivii"  
export GALLERY\_HOME="$DEV\_HOME/rogues\_gallery"  
export CV\_MASTER="$GALLERY\_HOME/curriculum\_vitae\_multiplex.md"  
export MASK\_INDEX="$GALLERY\_HOME/tabula\_personarum.csv"

Each mask gets its own view file, generated from the same source:

export MASK\_VIEWS="$GALLERY\_HOME/personae"  
Example individual view paths:  
$MASK\_VIEWS/persona\_scholar\_resume.md  
$MASK\_VIEWS/persona\_artist\_resume.md  
$MASK\_VIEWS/persona\_architect\_resume.md

III. Tabula personarum: the rogue’s gallery index

Keep this as a CSV or markdown table you can sort and filter. For example:

| mask\_id | nomen\_personae | everyday\_name | role\_vector | tone\_register | visibility\_scope | motto\_latin |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01 | Persona Sapiens | Scholar | research, teaching | precise, analytic | academia, institutions | Finis coronat opus |
| 02 | Persona Fabulator | Story-engineer | fiction, narrative | experimental, mythic | art, publishing | Theatrum mundi |
| 03 | Persona Mechanica | Systems Architect | code, infra, tooling | rigorous, schematic | tech, collab dev | Ars est celare artem |
| 04 | Persona Errans | Rogue / Trickster | hybrid, liminal | playful, transgressive | special projects | In medias res |

You can extend with columns like primary\_media, key\_tags, canonical\_color, etc.

IV. Master CV template (curriculum\_vitae\_multiplex.md)

This file is the one true source. Every entry must know which masks can claim it.

Skeleton:

Title line: Curriculum Vitae Multiplex

Praefatio (short paragraph stating that this CV is the total course of life, and that all resumés are filtered resumptions of this file.)

Axis Vitae (chronological backbone)  
Use entries like this, each tagged:

\[YYYY–YYYY\] Role Title  
Institution / Org  
Two to four lines of description.  
Tags: personae={01,03}; domains={teaching, writing}; media={text}

Opera Selecta (selected works and outputs)  
For each work:

Title of work  
Venue / platform, year  
Short description and impact.  
Tags: personae={02,04}; domains={fiction, hybrid}; media={text, performance}

Appendices (publications, exhibitions, talks, code, commissions, etc.)  
Everything still tagged with personae and domains.

The key is the tags line. You can make it machine-friendly, for example:

Tags: personae=\[01,03\]; domains=\[teaching,writing\]; media=\[text\]

V. Mask-specific resumé template (one mask at a time)

Each resumé is a lens, not a separate truth. Template:

Title line: Resumé: Persona Fabulator

Subheading: dramatis persona: fabulator in theatrum mundi  
Optional epigraph in Latin that matches the mask’s vibe.

Section: Intentio  
One or two sentences describing what this mask is for.  
Example: “This resumé resumes the course of life as it pertains to narrative design, experimental fiction, and mythic systems.”

Section: Qualificatio (summary)  
Three to five dense lines that capture this persona’s arc, using only entries from the master CV whose personae tag includes this mask\_id.

Section: Experientia Selecta  
Reverse-chronological roles, but only entries tagged for this persona. Same underlying text as the master CV, just selected.

Section: Opera Selecta  
Selected works where the mask tag matches. Brief, high-impact descriptions.

Section: Educatio  
Education, again filtered to what matters for this persona, but all pulled from the shared CV text.

Section: Appendix Brevis  
Optional compressed list of other relevant roles or works, still all drawn from the master file.

VI. Operational protocol: toggling masks

The concept is: you never write separate lives; you write one life with multiple personae flags, then “toggle” which flags are visible.

Concrete workflow:

First, update CV\_MASTER with new roles and works, making sure each one has a personae tag line that includes the relevant mask\_ids.

Second, update MASK\_INDEX if you introduce a new mask or change its description or motto.

Third, generate a resumé by choosing a mask\_id, then filtering CV\_MASTER to show only entries where personae includes that id, arranged in resumé order. You can do this by hand at first; later it can be scripted.

Fourth, give each resumé a clear Latin-framed header, so anyone reading it understands this is one mask of a larger theatrum mundi.

VII. Latin phrasing you can drop directly into the documents

To make the meta explicit:

At top of CV\_MASTER:  
“Theatrum mundi: hic totus curriculum vitae multiplex continetur; resumé personarum sunt tantum variae resumptiones huius cursus.”

Translation in plain English under it if you like.

At top of each resumé:  
“Dramatis persona: \[name\]. Haec resumé est resumptio selecta ex curriculum vitae multiplex, per hanc personam filtrata.”

If you tell me three to five concrete masks you actually want to use (for example: scholar, experimental artist, infrastructure engineer, horror writer, educator), I can fill in a ready-to-paste tabula\_personarum row set and one full resumé template instantiated for a specific mask.

## Prompt:
Different mask & different stages

## Response:
Thought for 43s

Think of it this way: same actor, many masks, and each mask plays differently depending on which stage and which moment of the life-run it appears on.

I will give you a reusable schema you can drop into your CV / résumé system: one axis for masks, one for life-stages, one for “stages” in the theatrical sense (contexts, audiences).

1.  Axes: actor, masks, stages

Subiectum  
This is you, the underlying actor. It never changes.

Personae  
These are your masks. Each one is a filter on the same underlying life. For example:  
Persona Sapiens (scholar)  
Persona Mechanica (systems / infra)  
Persona Fabulator (narrative / myth)  
Persona Errans (rogue / experimental)

Aetas  
Temporal stages of your life / work. Example Latin labels:  
Aetas Primaria = formative stage (training, early experiments, “origin story”)  
Aetas Media = early career consolidation (first serious outputs, first stable roles)  
Aetas Multiplex = parallel tracks and hybridization (multiple masks active, cross-overs)  
Aetas Transitus = pivot / metamorphosis stages (big shifts, reinventions)

Scaenae  
Literal or metaphorical “stages” where you perform the mask. For example:  
Scaena Academica = classrooms, conferences, journals  
Scaena Technica = repos, infra, dev orgs  
Scaena Artistica = galleries, festivals, publications, screenings  
Scaena Civica = community, public projects, institutions  
Scaena Occulta = underground, pseudonymous, experimental spaces

Every entry in your master CV belongs to one actor (you), but can be tagged with one or more personae, one aetas, and one or more scaenae.

2.  How to encode an entry: one source, many views

In your curriculum\_vitae\_multiplex file, describe each role once, then give it metadata.

Example entry in plain text:

Title: Visiting Lecturer in Hybrid Narrative Systems  
Place: Department of X, University Y  
Years: 2021–2023  
Description: Designed and taught experimental courses connecting mythic structures, interactive fiction, and code-driven narrative engines. Supervised student projects in multimodal storytelling and computational poetics.

Then attach a compact metadata line:

Tags: personae=\[Persona Sapiens, Persona Fabulator\]; aetas=Aetas Media; scaenae=\[Scaena Academica, Scaena Artistica\]

The same event can now be pulled into:  
a scholar CV (Persona Sapiens, all aetas)  
an artist CV (Persona Fabulator, all aetas)  
a technical résumé (because of its “systems” relevance, if you include Persona Mechanica later)  
a stage-specific dossier for Scaena Academica only (teaching + research)

Keyboard shortcut note: in most editors you can use Command+F / Control+F to jump between “Tags:” lines, and Option+Click / Alt+Click for multi-cursor editing if you want to update mask names everywhere at once.

3.  Different masks across the same stages

Imagine Aetas Multiplex as a crowded act where several masks step forward depending on the stage.

Within Aetas Multiplex you might have:

Persona Sapiens on Scaena Academica  
Scholarly publications, conference talks, committee work. Tags emphasize research, pedagogy, academic leadership.

Persona Mechanica on Scaena Technica  
Infrastructure scripts, OS design, GitHub organizations, automation frameworks. Tags emphasize systems, reliability, architecture.

Persona Fabulator on Scaena Artistica  
Fiction, film, performance, interactive web pieces, myth-splicing projects. Tags emphasize narrative, myth, experimental form.

Persona Errans on Scaena Occulta  
Pseudonymous work, boundary-pushing experiments, things that stay off the main, “official” record but still belong to the life-course.

Practically, when you generate a mask-specific résumé you filter first by persona, then optionally by aetas and scaena. For example: Persona Mechanica plus Aetas Multiplex plus Scaena Technica gives a clean, tech-facing résumé that still comes from the same source file.

4.  Same mask across different stages

Now flip it: track how one persona evolves through the life-course. Take Persona Fabulator.

Aetas Primaria + Scaena Artistica  
Early publications, student films, chapbooks, zines, tiny readings or screenings. Emphasis: raw experimentation and first attempts.

Aetas Media + Scaena Academica and Scaena Artistica  
Projects where narrative and theory cross: a thesis, a scholarly article about myth, a performance-lecture. Emphasis: building authority and vocabulary.

Aetas Multiplex + Scaena Technica and Scaena Artistica  
Operating-system-like projects, generative engines, multimodal myth architectures. Emphasis: narrative as system, story as interface.

Aetas Transitus (whenever it occurs)  
Major pivot: perhaps a large-scale work, a book, or a shift in medium. Emphasis: the moment this mask “sheds its skin” and becomes something else.

In a dossier for Persona Fabulator you can choose to show the full arc (all aetas), or focus on a single stage if you want a sharply framed snapshot.

5.  Making the “different stages” visible in the documents

In the master CV, use subheadings grouped by aetas so the temporal stage is always visible:

Aetas Primaria – Initiationis  
Then list entries tagged with that aetas.

Aetas Media – Consolidationis  
Then its entries, and so on.

Within each temporal stage, you can sort entries by scaenae and personae in prose. For example:

Under Aetas Multiplex you might write:

On Scaena Academica, Persona Sapiens consolidated a teaching and research profile in hybrid narrative systems, evidenced by \[…\].  
On Scaena Technica, Persona Mechanica architected and maintained the creative-technical infrastructure, including \[…\].  
On Scaena Artistica, Persona Fabulator developed and presented works that translated these structures into affective, public-facing forms, such as \[…\].

You never break the Latin-theatre conceit: reader is always reminded that these are masks walking on and off different stages in different acts.

6.  Minimal implementation layer

If you want a concrete switchboard for your filters, you can define a few environment variables to drive scripts or just to keep things mentally organized:

export MASK\_CURRENT="Persona\_Fabulator"  
export AETAS\_FILTER="Aetas\_Multiplex"  
export SCAENAE\_FILTER="Scaena\_Artistica,Scaena\_Technica"

Conceptually, changing MASK\_CURRENT is “changing masks,” changing AETAS\_FILTER is “jumping to a different act in the play,” and changing SCAENAE\_FILTER is “stepping from one stage to another.”

In an editor, you can quickly clone and tweak a resumé variant by selecting all occurrences of MASK\_CURRENT (Command+D / Control+D repeatedly to multi-select) and swapping the persona or stage labels.

If you would like, I can now write one fully worked example: a single role or project written once in the master CV style, then shown as it would appear in three different mask-and-stage configurations.
