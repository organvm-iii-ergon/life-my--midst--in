## Core Concepts

### CV (Curriculum Vitae)
**Definition**: The complete, append-only professional history of an individual.
**Analogy**: Blockchain ledger — immutable, comprehensive, chronological.
**Usage**: The CV is the source of truth from which all derived views are generated.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/cv.ts`, `packages/schema/src/curriculum-vitae.ts`

### Résumé
**Definition**: A context-specific, filtered snapshot derived from the CV.
**Analogy**: Light client or state snapshot — optimized for a particular moment or audience.
**Usage**: Generated by applying a Mask to the CV data.
**Key Insight**: Multiple résumés can exist for the same CV, each filtered differently.

### Profile
**Definition**: The primary container for a user's professional identity data.
**Contains**: Identity information, experiences, education, projects, skills, credentials.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/profile.ts`
**API**: `GET /profiles/:id`

### Identity
**Definition**: The unique, persistent, verifiable core of a professional persona.
**Contains**: DID, wallet address, ENS name, external IDs (LinkedIn, GitHub, ORCID).
**Invariants**: Core thesis, values, and competencies that remain constant across all Masks.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/identity.ts`

### Identity Invariants
**Definition**: Core attributes that remain unchanged regardless of which Mask is applied.
**Examples**: Professional thesis, ethical boundaries, fundamental competencies.
**Purpose**: Ensures all résumé variations truthfully represent the same person.

## Theatrical Metaphor

The system uses theatrical terminology to describe professional identity presentation. This is **non-negotiable** — all implementations must honor this covenant.

### Mask
**Definition**: A context-specific identity filter that transforms how the CV is presented.
**Not**: A lie or deception — a perspective on the same underlying truth.
**Function**: Filters content, adjusts tone, reweights priorities based on context.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/mask.ts`

#### Mask Categories

**Cognitive Masks** (How you think):
| Mask | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Analyst** | Data-driven, metrics-focused, empirical reasoning |
| **Synthesist** | Pattern-finding, connecting, systems-thinking |
| **Observer** | Reflective, metacognitive, quality-aware |
| **Strategist** | Forward-looking, goal-oriented, tactical |
| **Speculator** | Creative, hypothetical, exploratory |
| **Interpreter** | Meaning-maker, communicator, translator |

**Expressive Masks** (How you express):
| Mask | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Artisan** | Quality-obsessed, process-driven, detail-oriented |
| **Architect** | Design-focused, abstraction-oriented, structural |
| **Narrator** | Story-driven, context-aware, explanatory |
| **Provoker** | Provocative, challenging, opinion-driven |
| **Mediator** | Diplomatic, consensus-seeking, bridge-building |

**Operational Masks** (How you execute):
| Mask | Function |
|------|----------|
| **Executor** | Fast, decisive, action-oriented |
| **Steward** | Caring, responsible, ethical |
| **Integrator** | Holistic, connecting silos, coherent |
| **Custodian** | Protective, preserving, maintaining |
| **Calibrator** | Balancing, optimizing, fine-tuning |

### Epoch
**Definition**: A meaningful temporal period in professional evolution.
**Purpose**: Divides career into narrative arcs, not just chronological segments.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/epoch.ts`

| Epoch | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Initiation** | Entry, foundational skills, first exposure |
| **Emergence** | Early growth, finding direction |
| **Consolidation** | Integration, signature voice development |
| **Divergence** | Branching experimentation, exploring new paths |
| **Mastery** | Peak specialization, expert-level proficiency |
| **Reinvention** | Identity transformation, major pivots |
| **Transmission** | Teaching, mentoring, sharing knowledge |
| **Legacy** | Long-term impact, codification of contributions |

### Scaenae (Stages)
**Definition**: Theatrical contexts/stages that determine which Masks are appropriate.
**Latin Origin**: "scaenae" = stages (plural of scaena).
**Purpose**: Different contexts demand different identity presentations.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/scaenae.ts`

| Stage | Context | Typical Masks |
|-------|---------|---------------|
| **Academica** | Educational, research-driven | Analyst, Interpreter |
| **Technica** | Technical, engineering-focused | Architect, Executor |
| **Artistica** | Creative, expressive | Artisan, Narrator |
| **Civica** | Public, civic engagement | Mediator, Steward |
| **Domestica** | Personal, intimate | Observer, Custodian |
| **Occulta** | Private, hidden (fully redacted) | N/A |

### Activity Frames (Work Stages)
**Definition**: Distinct phases of work activity that complement theatrical Scaenae.
**Purpose**: Describes *what kind of work* is being done, while Scaenae describe *where/for whom*.
**Relationship to Scaenae**: Scaenae = audience context; Activity Frames = work mode.
**Location**: Referenced in mask-stage affinity matrices (`packages/content-model/src/mask-selection.ts`)

| Activity Frame | Description | Primary Masks |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| **Inquiry** | Research, exploration, question-formation | Analyst, Observer |
| **Design** | Ideation, architectural thinking | Architect, Synthesist |
| **Construction** | Production, implementation | Executor, Artisan |
| **Calibration** | Testing, refinement, verification | Calibrator, Analyst |
| **Transmission** | Publishing, dissemination | Narrator, Interpreter |
| **Reflection** | Retrospective analysis | Observer, Synthesist |
| **Negotiation** | Alignment, stakeholder engagement | Mediator, Strategist |
| **Archival** | Documentation, versioning | Custodian, Steward |

**Note**: Activity Frames and Scaenae are orthogonal dimensions:
- You can be in **Academica** (scaena) doing **Construction** (activity frame)
- Or in **Technica** (scaena) doing **Reflection** (activity frame)

### Tabula Personarum
**Definition**: The complete registry of all available Masks for a profile.
**Latin Origin**: "tabula personarum" = table/list of characters (dramatis personae).
**Contains**: Mask definitions, activation rules, visibility settings per stage.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/tabula-personarum.ts`

### Aetas
**Definition**: The interactive timeline showing professional evolution through Epochs.
**Latin Origin**: "aetas" = age, period, era.
**Implementation**: D3.js-based visualization in web frontend.
**Related Component**: `apps/web/src/components/AetasTimeline.tsx`

### Narrative Block
**Definition**: A weighted unit of content generated for a specific Mask/context.
**Contains**: Content, relevance weight, epoch association, tags.
**Purpose**: Enables ranking and filtering of CV content for different audiences.
**Location**: `packages/schema/src/narrative.ts`

## Blockchain-CV Analogy

The system uses blockchain concepts as architectural metaphors:

| Blockchain Concept | CV System Equivalent | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------------------|---------|
| **Ledger** | CV (full history) | Complete, append-only record |
| **State Snapshot** | Résumé | Derived view at a point in time |
| **Block** | Experience/Project entry | Timestamped, immutable record |
| **Consensus** | Verification layer | Agreement on claim validity |
| **Signature** | VC cryptographic proof | Non-repudiable attestation |
| **DID** | Professional identity | Unique, persistent identifier |
| **Zero-Knowledge Proof** | Selective disclosure | Prove claims without revealing all data |
| **Light Client** | Filtered résumé | Minimal view with proof of completeness |
| **Soulbound Token** | Career milestone badge | Non-transferable achievement record |

### DID (Decentralized Identifier)
**Definition**: A W3C standard for unique, persistent, verifiable digital identifiers.
**Format**: `did:ethr:0x...` or `did:web:example.com`
**Purpose**: Enables cryptographic proof of identity ownership.
**Standard**: [W3C DID Core](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/)

### VC (Verifiable Credential)
**Definition**: A W3C standard for cryptographically signed attestations.
**Purpose**: Third-party verification of claims (employment, degrees, certifications).

## Technical Architecture

### Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
**Definition**: An architectural pattern separating core logic from external concerns.
**Layers**:
- **Routes**: Thin orchestration layer (Fastify handlers)
- **Services**: Pure business logic (no framework dependencies)
- **Repositories**: Data access abstraction
- **DB**: Actual Postgres/Redis calls

**Benefit**: Core logic can be tested independently of HTTP framework or database.
**Location**: `apps/api/src/` follows this pattern

### Schema-First Design
**Definition**: All data models defined as Zod schemas before any implementation.
**Location**: `packages/schema/` is the single source of truth.
**Benefit**: Type safety, runtime validation, and auto-generated TypeScript types.
**Rule**: Never modify data structures without updating schema package first.

### Repository Pattern
**Definition**: Abstract data access behind interfaces.
**Implementation**: Dual implementations — MemoryRepository (testing) and PostgresRepository (production).
**Location**: `apps/api/src/db/`, `apps/orchestrator/src/db/`

### Monorepo
**Definition**: Single repository containing multiple packages and applications.
**Manager**: pnpm with workspaces
**Build**: Turborepo for dependency graph awareness
**Structure**: `apps/` (deployable), `packages/` (shared libraries)

### Module Boundaries
**Definition**: Rules governing which packages can import from which.
**Allowed**:
- Apps → Packages
- `content-model`, `core` → `schema`

**Forbidden**:
- Apps ↔ Apps (no cross-app imports)
- `schema` → any other package (foundational)
- Packages → Apps
