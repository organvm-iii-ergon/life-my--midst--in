# Security Policy

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

To report a security vulnerability, please use [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/4444J99/life-my--midst--in/security/advisories/new) rather than opening a public issue.

We will acknowledge receipt within 48 hours and aim to publish a fix within 7 days for confirmed issues.

## Security Guidelines

For the full security checklist (secrets management, environment isolation, CSP headers, auth hardening), see [docs/SECURITY.md](../docs/SECURITY.md).
