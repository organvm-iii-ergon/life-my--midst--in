## Prompt:
Develop prospecting/qualifying questions for prompting deep research for current project; give each domain a separate code window w. Full prompt ai handoff;

3/3

## Response:
Below is a structured set of **prospecting / qualifying question packs** engineered specifically for **deep-research prompting** in your current project (interactive CV/résumé system, identity masks, narrative arcs, schema/architecture, product roadmap, etc.).  
Each domain is delivered in a **separate code window** containing a **full prompt handoff** ready to be used verbatim in any AI workflow.

If you want, I can also generate a _meta-orchestrator prompt_ that dynamically selects across these modules.

1\. Identity, Narrative, and Masks
----------------------------------

```
You are an analytical researcher tasked with extracting the underlying identity architecture, narrative invariants, and persona masks for a multi-layered interactive CV/résumé system.

Research Task:
- Map the fundamental identity thesis that must remain stable across all masks, epochs, or narrative expressions.
- Identify claims requiring external verification (credentials, dates, collaborations, institutions).
- Analyze temporal arcs and creative phases: their triggers, outputs, transitions, and discontinuities.
- Surface tensions or contradictions within the identity and classify them as productive, structural, or removable.
- Identify hidden or non-obvious intellectual lineages (movements, theorists, artistic traditions, technical schools).
- Document strategic differentiators that competitors rarely emphasize but this profile can uniquely own.
- Determine which identity components must be modular, mask-based, or contextually activated.
- Identify attack vectors from skeptical evaluators and specify evidence that neutralizes each.

Output Requirements:
- Identity thesis summary.
- Mask taxonomy with purpose, activation context, constraints, and affordances.
- Narrative evolution map (phases, boundaries, catalysts).
- Verification checklist for external fact-tracing.
- Tension matrix with recommended treatments.
- Intellectual lineage diagram (text-based).
- Differentiator inventory.
- Skeptic-proofing dossier.

Ask clarifying questions **only if required** for precision.

2\. Product Strategy, Roadmapping, and Scoping
----------------------------------------------

```
You are conducting strategic discovery to define the product boundaries, constraints, and resource topology for an interactive CV/résumé platform. Time is represented as units of energy/effort rather than calendar dates.

Research Task:
- Identify core value propositions and “jobs to be done” for the platform.
- Determine minimum viable features, expandable modules, and future-phase capabilities.
- Map stakeholder segments (user, reviewer, institution, collaborator).
- Surface risk factors and dependencies (technical, regulatory, narrative).
- Define energy-based time horizons (E1 immediate, E2 mid-range, E3 long-range).
- Identify resource classes needed (technical, narrative, editorial, design, compliance).
- Conduct competitive landscape analysis, including analogous systems (blockchain CV, DID, VC, traditional résumé tools).
- Detect leverage points where small energy investments create outsized returns.

Output Requirements:
- Product concept map.
- Feature-stack decomposition.
- Stakeholder matrix.
- Risk registers and mitigation paths.
- Effort-based timeline (E1/E2/E3).
- Resource plan.
- Competitive differentiation narrative.

Ask clarifying questions only if needed.

3\. Technical Architecture, Infrastructure, Data Models
-------------------------------------------------------

```
You are auditing and designing the technical architecture for a modular, mask-enabled, interactive résumé system that may include DID, verifiable credentials, schema registries, and interactive media rendering.

Research Task:
- Determine all architectural components required (frontend, backend, identity, storage, provenance, rendering, versioning).
- Identify interfaces between modules (APIs, contracts, schemas).
- Propose data models and entity relationships for identity layers, masks, narratives, credentials, and interaction logs.
- Evaluate on-chain/off-chain splits for trust, speed, and storage.
- Identify standards (DID, VC, schema.org, custom schemas) that should be adopted or extended.
- Assess security, privacy, and consent models.
- Determine scalability mechanisms and future-proofing strategies.

Output Requirements:
- Architecture diagram (textual or ASCII if needed).
- Component descriptions.
- Interface definitions.
- Data-schema specification.
- Security and trust model.
- Future-architecture migration paths.

Ask clarifying questions only if necessary.

4\. Schema Specification, Ontologies, and Data Governance
---------------------------------------------------------

```
You are designing a schema and ontology for representing identity, narrative phases, masks, credentials, and temporal arcs in a structured and machine-interpretable form.

Research Task:
- Identify all required entities, attributes, relationships, and constraints.
- Define canonical forms for identity invariants, modular masks, timelines, credentials, and narrative states.
- Map validation logic and required external references.
- Define versioning behavior for the schema.
- Evaluate alignment with existing standards (schema.org/Person, EIP-712, W3C VCs, JSON-LD).
- Document required governance rules for updates, extensions, and deprecations.

Output Requirements:
- Full schema with entities, fields, types, constraints.
- Narrative and identity ontology map.
- Versioning policy.
- Validation rules.
- Governance model.

Ask clarifying questions only if needed.

5\. Concept Deck / Positioning Framework
----------------------------------------

```
You are developing a concept deck that positions the interactive CV/résumé system as a category-defining artifact.

Research Task:
- Define the central concept in precise, differentiated language.
- Map audience segments and their differing expectations.
- Identify metaphors that elegantly explain the system (e.g., blockchain as résumé analogue).
- Generate narrative scaffolds: problem framing, solution overview, architecture summary, value narrative.
- Derive 3–5 conceptual frames (e.g., ontological, functional, artistic, computational).
- Identify how masks, temporal arcs, and identity invariants integrate into the deck.

Output Requirements:
- One-page concept definition.
- Multi-frame positioning matrix.
- Audience segmentation and message tailoring.
- Core narrative modules for slide deck.
- Visual metaphors and structural language.

Ask clarifying questions only if required.

6\. Persona Masks, Stages, Epochs, and Settings
-----------------------------------------------

```
You are mapping ontological-functional, non-branded persona masks; their roles; their activation contexts; and their representation across stages, epochs, and narrative settings.

Research Task:
- Identify the full taxonomy of masks and their operational functions.
- Define dimensions: cognitive stance, communicative stance, temporal alignment, narrative purpose.
- Map transitions among masks and across epochs.
- Determine how each mask reframes the identity while preserving invariants.
- Identify stage/epoch boundaries, conditions for entering/exiting, and markers of evolution.
- Document emergent tensions or contradictions each mask helps resolve.

Output Requirements:
- Mask taxonomy table.
- Activation/transition matrix.
- Epoch map.
- Setting descriptors.
- Identity invariance rules per mask.

Ask clarifying questions only if needed.

7\. Research-Oriented Prospector for Deep Background / Lineage
--------------------------------------------------------------

```
You are conducting lineage and influence excavation for a creative–technical professional across art, academia, and programming.

Research Task:
- Identify intellectual traditions, movements, schools, and thinkers relevant to the profile.
- Classify direct vs. indirect influences.
- Map cross-disciplinary bridges (art–code, theory–practice, identity–system design).
- Identify gaps or underexplored areas requiring deeper research.
- Provide curated source directions for deeper inquiry.

Output Requirements:
- Influence map.
- Primary and secondary lineage strands.
- Cross-disciplinary matrix.
- Recommended research pathways.

Ask clarifying questions only if needed.

If you'd like, I can now:

1.  Combine all modules into a **single unified “super-prompt”** orchestrator.
2.  Add **auto-scoring qualifiers** to prioritize research depth.
3.  Create **API-ready versions** for programmatic use in your system.
