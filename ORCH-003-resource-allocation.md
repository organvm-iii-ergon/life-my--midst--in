## Prompt:
role-based resource distribution (engineer, designer, researcher);

## Response:
Below is a concise, implementation-ready **role-based resource distribution model** for the interactive CV/résumé project. It is structured for immediate integration into your project plan and effort-unit framework.

* * *

Role-Based Resource Distribution
--------------------------------

Assuming total project capacity = 100 effort units (EU).  
Adjust percentages as you refine scope.

### 1\. Engineering (Backend, Frontend, Systems)

**Total: 50 EU (50 percent)**  
Focus: infrastructure, data pipelines, interaction engine, schema/ontology implementation.

Breakdown:

*   Core data model, schema integration, storage: **12 EU**
*   Interaction engine, API layer, generative runtime: **15 EU**
*   Frontend UI/UX implementation (reactive interactive résumé): **10 EU**
*   Integration with identity modules / verification: **6 EU**
*   Build pipeline, CI/CD, systems reliability: **7 EU**

### 2\. Design (Product, UX/UI, Interaction, Narrative Experience)

**Total: 30 EU (30 percent)**  
Focus: interaction frameworks, narrative-mask system, user pathways, visual identity.

Breakdown:

*   Experience architecture (modes, masks, narrative pathways): **10 EU**
*   UX flows, wireframes, interaction prototypes: **8 EU**
*   Visual system: typography, layout, design tokens: **6 EU**
*   Motion/interaction polish & micro-interactions: **4 EU**
*   Usability testing & refinement: **2 EU**

### 3\. Research (Content, Ontology, Narrative Semantics, Verification Systems)

**Total: 20 EU (20 percent)**  
Focus: conceptual backbone, knowledge graphs, identity frameworks, prompt strategy.

Breakdown:

*   Ontological + semantic schema (masks, periods, identity invariants): **8 EU**
*   Narrative research, evidence chains, verification modules: **4 EU**
*   Data acquisition, external references, benchmarking: **3 EU**
*   Continuous prompt optimization + AI agent strategy: **3 EU**
*   Systems alignment research (security, provenance, traceability): **2 EU**

* * *

High-Level View
---------------

*   **Engineering:** majority investment because the interactive CV is fundamentally a systems + interaction product.
*   **Design:** heavy involvement early for the multi-mask narrative model and persistent throughout for user experience.
*   **Research:** the backbone ensuring semantic integrity, identity invariants, and consistency.

* * *

If you want, I can convert this into:

1.  A Gantt-like timeline using effort units.
2.  A role-by-phase matrix.
3.  A budgetary model.
4.  A capability-based allocation (e.g., ML engineer vs. full-stack vs. interaction designer).
