## Appendix: Technology Decisions

### Job Integration Method
**Decision:** Mix of APIs and smart scraping
- LinkedIn: Official API when approved, otherwise scraping
- Indeed: Official API for easy apply, scraping for other
- Google: SERP scraping (lowest friction)
- Backup dataset for offline testing

### Document Generation
**Decision:** Template-based initially, ML fine-tuning in Phase 3
- Phase 2: Improve templates, add formatting
- Phase 3: Fine-tuned model for optimal generation
- Document correctness validation in renderer

### Auto-Apply
**Decision:** Hybrid approach (API + form auto-fill)
- LinkedIn: Native API when available
- Indeed: Form automation via Puppeteer/Playwright
- Generic forms: Parse + fill via AI

### Autonomous Agent Framework
**Decision:** Custom event-driven system (vs LangChain)
- Rationale: Better control, cost optimization, transparency
- Fallback: Evaluate LangChain agents if custom too complex
- Observability is baked into event stream

---

## Observability & Feedback Loops

1. Create multi-source dashboards: integration health, quota exhaustion, document pipeline latency.
2. Feed telemetry into ranking models, so slow searches penalize future recommendations.
3. User-facing feedback buttons right within dashboard to drive ranking adjustments.
4. Alerting rules for quota exhaustion spikes, auto-apply failures, and ML pipeline freshness.

## Risk Mitigation

1. Build dual-path job search: provider + cached dataset, to avoid outages.
2. Implement circuit breaker around auto-apply to pause after repeated failures.
3. Maintain manual override for document generation in case ML drift occurs.
4. Keep backup Stripe keys and test migrations for rolling out new plans.
